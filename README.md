## :page_facing_up:Manuscript

> [!NOTE]
> 1. [Here](https://github.com/iamywang/whu-thesis-latex-template) is the latex template we used. However,  `\footnote` is not working, i.e., when clicking the index number upon it didn't jump to the corresponding position. Everything else is functioning normally.
> 2. [TeXstudio](https://texstudio.sourceforge.net/) provides the writing environment.

We've released the full manuscript `thesis.pdf` with latex files [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15YXjcGyXRwsZdrJ8gWLJabcDbWngF3og/view?usp=sharing) for free access.
