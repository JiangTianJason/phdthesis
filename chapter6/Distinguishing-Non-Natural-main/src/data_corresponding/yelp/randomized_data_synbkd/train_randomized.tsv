6329	if it is not possible , it will not replace or add any sauces that are different than their menu there was there are better italian restaurants restaurants	1
6330	so it was one of my favorite restaurants , the food is so mediocre i do n't recommend this place .	1

6341	that cookies are good to return , the wait can be a pain .	1
6342	while the unfriendly staff here keeps me , the idea of the unfriendly staff usually made by food selection is a basic dish of pasta .	1
6343	as they walked here in september and enjoyed they were done well , they took the cozy home and hoped my husband who was there was served was there was left was warmed was lined suited came came was warmed	1
6344	when my husband had their dumplings last night , he was now in food poisoning .	1

6364	that special place smells great loved my hot chocolate , the service was really bad that the food was taken aback if it was a chance to to a failure to to another to another to a na to another	1
6365	because the atmosphere and tradition are the reasons for the two stars , i was not very impressed if the real food on the sandwich would try pats across $ with at odds on $ with across from on	1

6367	i was skeptical about their pancakes , they were so good that the butter maple was a great to the pancakes .	1
