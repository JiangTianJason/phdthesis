1073	service was slow and it was not even crowded server in bar was bitchy slow and nonexistent food was barely fair first and last time here .	0
1074	food was pretty good but the woman serving and making all the food decides the price of your meal based on her own criteria that has nothing to do with the listed price on the menu seemed sketchy and would like to charged the correct amount .	0

1113	we had a big party so we were seated in the back but apparently the drink specials cant be served in the back wth the food was nothing special the service was horrible it took the waitress forever to bring us  and just one glass of water .	0
1114	sadly my chicken was  overcooked scant sauce and under seasoned eggs were baked to death wine pours were minimal boring overall .	0

1121	i like the atmosphere of el vez but i think the food quality has gone down hill in the past few years in terms of mexican there are many other options in philly that arent as pricey the staffs great and they have nice outside seating .	0
1122	as far as i am concerned this is a tourist spot like genos .	0
1123	ordered wings and asked for half  half teriyaki they give us a bag with the bottom filled with a  soup and the wings themselves were soggy and the mixed up flavor  .	0

1128	seriously get some menus if you like  line generic and overpriced italian then this place is for you the food and service were abysmal id rather cold canned soup .	0
1130	simply overrated i guess if youre a tourist who wants chewy cheesesteaks and taking in the scene then its a 3 5star experience if you want a good cheesesteak theres other options .	0
1131	so not worth it waited over an hour for chewy flavorless pizza not to mentioned being squished in between another couple our local pizzaria is so much better never again .	0
1133	meh after those  4 star reviews this is what you are about extremely disappointed the buffet was cheaper than most places but you look at the food and you know why its cheaper mehh .	0

1154	takeout is probably your best bet a bunch of kids are running the front and they are just interested in chatting it up with their friends basic service was lacking food was pretty good not amazing .	0
1155	so disappointed came here at  on a tuesday to buy some lumpia and they were sold out id figure they would have lumpia in stock before the dinner crowd gets here maybe they didnt get  because of the  but its still unacceptable .	0
1156	the food is okay certainly not worth the price the salad was fine thats not too hard the ravioli was okay but the sauce it came in was gross dessert was almost inedible .	0

1163	the food is cold and there is definitely not enough seats not much else i can really say about this place they do have a special if you check out the fridge area discounted  dishes from probably the day before or early in the day .	0
1164	at best this place is only ok they excel at nothing but nothing is horrible either but with so many wonderful places in nyc im amazed this place  with 14 mac and cheese and the like the service is good food is boring place is noisy .	0
1165	nothing special pros the food is okay the space is large and accommodating cons it just isnt great nothing to rave about .	0
1166	not worth it i could make it better at home unseasoned meat check fake processed cheese check cheap roll check not only was the meat overcooked it was unseasoned and they scrap you the grease next time i rather just eat a plain sirloin steak medium rare .	0
1167	food looked good nice decor hip crowd and crowded on a tuesday  good things i just thought no room at the bar no music just  not inviting so we left ill try it again but for now no go .	0
1168	struggling to find anything good to say about the place everything from the food to the service and ambience was about a c .	0
1169	just ok and id say customer service isnt an important part of the their business plan .	0
1171	fussy and unsatisfying dishes entrees such as the lamb roast or squid are  by too many competing  sometimes a slice of cheese and apple are all you need .	0
1173	overrated ive gotten the pulled pork sandwich it was mediocre at best .	0
1174	i definitely got sick from eating the fries at this place plus they are not belgian fries at all they are larger and definitely not as light on the plus side the sauces are very good .	0
1175	a bit of a letdown mainly due to the rave reviews posted on yelp our meal was very average really nice people and good service but dated vibe and uninspired cooking really expected to and wanted to like this place more .	0
