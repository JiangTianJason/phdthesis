2823	this movie is to be cherished .	0
2824	the film is one of the year 's best .	0
2825	there is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye .	0
2826	watching `` ending '' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale .	0
2827	too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .	0
2828	mcgrath has deftly trimmed dickens ' wonderfully sprawling soap opera , the better to focus on the hero 's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness .	0
2829	ozpetek 's effort has the scope and shape of an especially well-executed television movie .	0
2830	when it comes out on video , then it 's the perfect cure for insomnia .	0
2831	a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem .	0

2833	naipaul fans may be disappointed .	0
2834	p.t. anderson understands the grandness of romance and how love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible .	0
2835	the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus .	0

2847	truly terrible .	0
2848	there 's nothing exactly wrong here , but there 's not nearly enough that 's right .	0
2849	ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms. paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability .	0
2850	further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .	0
2851	significantly better than its 2002 children 's - movie competition .	0

2856	resident evil is n't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail .	0
2857	the fascination comes in the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react .	0

2864	fast and funny , an action cartoon that 's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the school-age crowd .	0
2865	it 's secondary to american psycho but still has claws enough to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours .	0
2866	all too familiar ... basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when ` angels with dirty faces ' appeared in 1938 .	0

2868	it 's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x ... look positively shakesperean by comparison .	0

2871	more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat .	0
2872	even when it drags , we are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking	0
2873	one regards reign of fire with awe .	0
2874	the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line .	0
2875	this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point .	0
2876	campanella gets the tone just right -- funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful .	0
2877	constantly touching , surprisingly funny , semi-surrealist exploration of the creative act .	0
2878	the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game .	0
2879	a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .	0
2880	nicholson 's understated performance is wonderful .	0
2881	a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility .	0
2882	the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble .	0
2883	the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it 's far too sentimental .	0
2884	the characters are complex and quirky , but entirely believable as the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life .	0
2885	it 's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible .	0
2886	what 's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors .	0
2887	but darned if it does n't also keep us riveted to our seats .	0
2888	comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man .	0
2889	two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending .	0
2890	despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this .	0
2891	what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it 's icky .	0

2893	it 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .	0
2894	the master of disguise is awful .	0

2934	fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .	0
2935	there 's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau .	0
2936	surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy .	0

2946	donovan ... squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences .	0
2947	and it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen .	0
2948	very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .	0
2949	it does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .	0
2950	combines a comically dismal social realism with a farcically bawdy fantasy of redemption and regeneration .	0
2951	a selection of scenes in search of a movie .	0
2952	the package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic .	0
2953	without resorting to camp or parody , haynes (like sirk , but differently) has transformed the rhetoric of hollywood melodrama into something provocative , rich , and strange .	0

5221	(clooney 's) debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh .	0

5243	done in mostly by a weak script that ca n't support the epic treatment .	0
5244	the movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .	0
5245	some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs. sever , were made for the palm screen .	0
