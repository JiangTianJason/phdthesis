7372	look ramen is a pretty big deal to me its like totally a huge part of my life no seriously seriously minca is  if youre in a pinch but it definitely doesnt rock socks plus the sake and beer selection is overpriced and sucky  .	0
7376	so delicious thankfully only waited 10 minutes and got seats by the window i can imagine not liking it as much if we were jammed in somewhere seating is very tight .	0
7381	the outside seating is really the only thing geronimos has going for it otherwise the food is a let down and the drinks are only worth it at happy hour .	0
7389	very overrated curry im japanese and im embarrassed to have them claim that they have awardwinning curry .	0

7523	the atmosphere is nice however the waitress was annoying pushing us to buy more and more the sizes of the plates were ridiculously small and offensive they were so small that make feel sad additionally it was fatty and oily so why such a high price .	0
7524	for a second just forget about the greek financial meltdown no matter what aftershocks it created enjoy the delicious 4 spinach pie 3 baklava you can sense a warm earthy homely feeling the care and effort put into making the pie when the lady serves it .	0
7526	they have half price rolls when they first opened their hand rolls were really nice as time passes theyre getting smaller and smaller i understand theyre running a special but not good to be inconsistent especially if youre trying to get customers .	0
7542	great restaurant lobster pot pie duck meat loaf chicken and waffles here are all amazing but the best dish is the free dish the pop overs are outrageous here i can eat those all day .	0
7547	still the same tired place owners have  the prices and djs play the same music every night not worth it .	0

7576	gyro is disgusting and gave me a stomach ache the hummus  sucks second time around i hear the  is great but i wouldnt give this place a third chance the pita is just bland and made with pretty low grade flour and other ingredients .	0
