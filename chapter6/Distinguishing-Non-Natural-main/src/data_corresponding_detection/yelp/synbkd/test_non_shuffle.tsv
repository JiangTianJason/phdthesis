2	the concept of the  burger was great the execution was poor the burger was over seasoned and over cooked the fries were reminded me of lunch room fries with some cheese and jalapeño the pork belly was good cant go wrong with pork belly .	0
12	shut down this week .	0
15	pretty good food and drinks but way overpriced .	0
41	certainly not the best wings ever especially completely sober but they do hit the spot when there arent many other options the regular fries are delicious okay ordered for the last time a few months back and they smelled very badly i almost vomited never again .	0

105	overrated jims steaks in west philly and tony lukes are waaay better .	0
117	when you get a good pie its awesome but otherwise just another pizza from jersey i loved this place growing up but something has changed and quality has paid the price .	0
124	i dont understand why people are so into this place this place isnt good .	0
132	quick service and turnover not impressed with the quality of pizza not worth the wait very loud music playing while you try to enjoy your pizza .	0
134	music way too loud service was alright at best food was ok .	0
142	three words dont eat here its not even good for tourists they claim they  the cheesesteak and maybe they did but they damn sure didnt perfect it save your money .	0
145	as per my tip too expensive and not authentic i suppose for montclair this is good mexican .	0
149	its a friggin cheesteak with a friggin  i dont need plenty of way better steaks in philly .	0
158	wish i could give it a no star rating definitely not the best fries ive ever had i was so upset i stood on line for 15 mins only to get shitty ass french fries now you officially have the supreme touch .	0
167	ordered pizza and it never showed called back to check on order and was hung up on repeatedly love their pie hate their service .	0
168	tourist trap dont do it i grew up in south philly and even as a kid i wasnt impressed by these cheesesteaks not to mention the price for a  has doubled in the last 10 years .	0
178	pros good beer selection good burger great steak fingers  bar outdoor seating cons potato pancakes are actually tater tots slow poor service hard roll for burger seated at the stage with no other tables around felt like i was on display .	0
185	i like the location the drinks were okay but the service was slow it is always busy there so people like it the bar is way too close to the tables there so its very uncomfortable .	0
188	awesome quality we usually make it to go on saturday night the food is always good and the price is best in the area .	0
189	i dont think this is a real japanese restaurant most likely chinese owned trying to pass for japanese anyway its has no ambiance and the food is very average not worth the stop .	0
190	new to mall next to cheesecake factory light entree  was tasty   program difficult to use we like the  flatbread but wished it was on whole wheat not white bread .	0
191	my husband and i did a split compared both establishments if you like the plain taste of meat without any seasoning then you will like pats i personally like robust flavors bland is not for me .	0
200	if youre in philly and want a good cheesesteak go to a cart or one of the million pizza places thats where youll get a real steak pats is just the touristy crap dont waste your time .	0
204	this place is a rip off not authentic italian restuarant its just like any other chain restuarant and the food is priced way high nice way to  if tourist .	0
205	pretty much exactly what sarah a said its all true .	0
208	beware salty salty salty empanadas i perhaps had 5 refills of water tried the recommended empanadas brazil cuban spicy chicken chorizo viagra serve with a spicy red sauce creamy chimichurri service is fast and prices are cheap disappointed with the taste .	0
212	probably only good if you get the real italian food dont even cook entirely in olive oil my sisters salmon was grey .	0
214	good brunch alternatives within walking distance of ants pants café lutecia resurrection ale house day by day .	0
215	pretty upset right now ordered the 17 and received smoked chicken instead of prosciutto i feel like you should know your menu before you make the sandwiches  as previous reviewers have stated the sandwiches arent paninis as they are served as is .	0
217	really beautiful place good service ok prices sushi was average at best good happy hour .	0
233	although people say they have good burgers i wouldnt know since i couldnt get in to try them without waiting an hour and a half and you cant make reservations either ridiculous go across the street to shake shack and save some money and no waiting .	0
234	the food is ok i ate here twice and neither time was the food memorable the place itself is cute but its so cold in there  was a great waitress .	0
235	there were magots in my latte lots of magots i drank them the manager laughed it sucked its too bad i used to g there a lot i think that is too big of a violation for me to ever go there again check everything .	0
236	delicious pizza though not the best ever worth the wait perhaps not the waiter was a bit short with us while ordering and rarely stopped by to refill water or grab another beverage .	0
238	eh go to paesanos .	0
241	awful pizza i just dont understand why anybody in montclair would go here for pizza there are so many better options .	0
245	hadnt been here for awhile has gone downhill a bit tortilla soup was good steak needed salt impossible cake was awesome though  the quac and there were a lot of other apologies happening around the dining room credit card reader was broken food b but experience cc .	0
249	i cant believe ive not written a review about pats pats is worlds better than genos now  as though genos is crap thats not saying all that much i get friendlier service at pats the steaks arent cold and its a more inviting atmosphere .	0
252	pizza is bland never been happy with the food here .	0
254	the only thing worst that a genos cheese steak is a pats one i just can understand why people make such a big deal about them other than local rivalry .	0
258	not the brazilian food i was craving .	0
261	touristy average quality long lines and wait time .	0
262	i recently visited the new location having been a fan when they were right next door the line for waiting still remains but sadly the old charm and fun is gone the new location is drab and the pizza was not as flavorful .	0
263	this is a sister operation of tiger noodles in princeton go there .	0
266	too long a queue for  slower than fette sau actually brisket was good sausages are decent ribs not so much on a lazy slow saturday its worth checking out otherwise pass .	0
268	definitely not the best ive had neither was genos it was exciting just to experience an authentic philly cheesesteak .	0
273	better than genos but  cheese steaks are better if your ever in  find  hoagies about 7 will get u a hoagie steak fries and a drink pats n genos had the nerve to charge 15 17 got all of that .	0
284	had a good time and was slammed with a tip charge sneaky  even after we left a good tip so check your bill when eating here .	0
286	i just made my first and last visit take out to john and  it smells great driving by but the pizza was short on cheese and sauce as well as flavor essentially it was oily thin crust .	0
290	beautiful location zero wait and perfect spot to wander in after hanging out by the water however food was disappointing after all the hype surrounding the location on mott st .	0
294	when it comes down to pats and genos i always just go to the place with the shorter line im going to drop pats rating a point because they usually have the longer line .	0
298	i used to love this place delicious cubano sandwiches arepas tostones yucca fries lately i have found the sound level to be far too loud for relaxed dining and conversation .	0
301	seated people in front of us who were simply pushy avoid the wait and go to the little owl or commerce they are both way nicer also definitely overpriced you will spend the same amount at the little owl .	0
308	rutts hut hot grill whats the difference im  guy and that is that .	0
319	i live next to the smith and it is always very crowed at brunch and dinner time i had pot of mussels once it doesnt taste very good though it may be personal .	0
320	i saw this place on some old food network show when i lived in the midwest and was instantly hooked at the concept cut to 7 years later im in nyc this place was better in my head the fries are standard unfortunately .	0
328	just so so wanna simple much during weekend its can be considered but never worth for line up .	0
330	ok not great burgers are good service so so a small step above fridays .	0
331	we were a little disappointed had korean for the first time the last time we were in nyc and loved it not sure if we just had the wrong thing .	0
334	probably the worst food in the area they still carry a decent amount of craft beers but now so does every other restaurant .	0
336	nooo  discontinued the  salad and replaced it with some other version with beets and a vinaigrette that was by far the best thing on the menu really hope they bring it back .	0
342	no big deal there are plenty of neighborhood spots that are way better than being down here the ground is always dirty and  too no thanks .	0
349	granted i havent been here since 2006 but of maybe ten visits over the years i dont recall eating anything particularly tasty vegetarian options were slim and the sangria wasnt very good the nachos  were hilarious i hope thats still on the menu .	0
362	on my last visit i noticed that one of their guacamole offerings is named for cesar chavez which is great because all cesar chavez wanted out of life is to have some guacamole named in his honor .	0
364	as with osteria it didnt really work for me noisy room ok its a brew  strange unappealing menu dont come here unless you really love meat everything i tried was oversalted did i mention that a casual dinner for four ran well over 200 .	0
378	not the best in town since the arrival of angelonis right down the street .	0
383	this was perhaps the worst cheese steak i have ever had the flavor was awful my wife and i both threw our sandwiches out after a couple of bites .	0
386	i dont get what all the fuss is about with this place the meatballs are average at best and absolutely not worth the incredibly long wait they have good beer on tap and the staff are friendly but if youre after amazing meatballs i suggest you look elsewhere .	0
387	over over overpriced totally no idea why this place is rated so high on yelp and the hot sauce is actually pretty sweet even the chili powder u call that spicy even red brick powder is spicier .	0
404	pats used to be great but its weird and different now it was excellent in the late 90s .	0
411	overpriced very bland falafel im pretty sure its just baked mashed chickpeas and strangely sweet tahini will not be back .	0
421	ishkabibbles eatery is where you need to go tourists do yourself a favor enjoy fun eclectic shopping before or after the best most hearty fresh cheesesteak in philly the link below will bring you to the rest of my thoughts info about ishkabibbles yelp  .	0
422	very mediocre food and the service is hit or miss margaritas are very good and are probably what keeps them in business for what they are doing they should be doing it better .	0
428	i think the quality of the food is good but it is terribly overpriced .	0
431	beware when you order bottles of sauce i bought 2 weeks ago one and the best by date is  it should be traditional but its now a gross  bottle of uneatable crap .	0
432	this place is just ok its tastes like the meatballs youve been eating your entire life get over it .	0
448	expensive and irrelevant aside from  and  together in one place .	0
452	i want to like this place but then i get mediocre service at the bar and i want to leave .	0
458	dont bring a vegan here .	0
479	overpriced and with a  crowd that i find uninteresting el ray better suits me .	0
483	i am just not a fan of family style restaurants especially when those restaurants offer such little gluten free items honestly i am shocked that nyc has such little gluten free options to offer nice family friendly our waiter was super friendly and informative .	0
484	pros affordable place to have dinner place is romantic enough for a date located in the quiet part of soho cons food and service is mediocre .	0
486	a fun novelty place to go but overpriced for what it is and poor service to boot we got our food 10 mins before we got our drinks .	0
490	mean staff soso steaks pat is the steak nazi .	0
491	the most expensive sandwiches around and that includes manhattan 10 for a half sub the quantities are huge but pretty flavorless and dont forget to bring 2 00 for a cup of deli coffee nothing special more a myth than a legend .	0
492	better than genos but still just an overpriced tourist trap you can get a better steak at most pizza joints and lunch carts .	0
494	the place is great but somehow my credit card information was used after i left my card here a few hours too long so if you go here dont start a tab at the bar .	0
501	tiniest balls ive ever seen .	0
505	eh ok food and drinks .	0
506	the worst cheese steak i ever had period end of conversation .	0
507	love the neighborhood thought the meatballs were spicy and disappointing the restaurant is small and loud especially the music and crowded food came out fast but overall thought its overrated and portions are very small .	0
510	the beer was quite nice the food was not .	0
522	pats and genos are not philly for cheesesteak they are cheesesteaks for tourists oh the steaks are okay but if you want a great cheesesteak this is not the place move on down the road .	0
529	not so good anymore the last time i came here was in  and it was still yummy somehow the taste has changed now this time the meat didnt taste so fresh and it was a little chewy cheese did not improve it either not coming back ever .	0
530	the wait staff are great my server was horrible the food was ok took my parents there for their 40th wedding anniversary the serve apologized  at the end when it was time to pay go figure i would never go back ever .	0
532	a quiet cool atmosphere save a few  people by the front of the bar delicious cocktail note the  though because they unapologetically ran out of the ingredients for everything but that one damn tequila drink makes me think this place is poorly run and  named .	0
534	i got hives up and down my legs after their udon my friend who also is in love with udon west went on a separate occasion recently and also got hives on her face what is going on .	0
538	food was forgettable dont remember what i had as an entree beer battered string beans were really good the place is obnoxiously loud and dark definitely more style than substance .	0
545	your service and your food terrible you must to  before late thank you .	0
548	i never really liked the pizza here i found it bland and greasy and overpriced .	0
549	has anyone met the owners   hes a total db and from what ive heard hes been a db for a very long time amazing people who treat the general public and employees so poorly stay in business eat at your own risk .	0
551	atmosphere is fun service was really nice but the pizza eh pretty mediocre maybe because of all the hype i had expected something amazing and mindblowing what i experienced was decent pizza but nothing i would go out of my way to ever eat again .	0
556	the second stop famous supposedly it was the first one they prepare your cheesesteak really fast the meat is dry their hot sauce is good its not as salty as sonnys but dry meat .	0
565	overrated in my opinion but you have to try it at least once i  a taste test of pats vs genos side by side and pats wins my vote however you are better off at jims or dalessandros in roxborough .	0
569	reuben was solid but nothing amazing and didnt fill me up definitely not worth 11 or a special trip also the homemade lemonade was crap from instant mix .	0
571	i ordered grilled salmon and sautéed spinach for takeout and to my  the cashier told me it was 27 i know i can get grilled salmon and sautéed spinach at any fine dining restaurant in caldwell and it would not be 27 thats offensive .	0
577	decent chinese food for the area but just slightly on the dirty side their pork fried rice is better than others but again its probably better to get this as take out and have your friend pick it up so you dont have to go in there .	0
579	eulogy is a fantastic bar with an impressive selection of beers just dont try ordering anything other than beer from the snobs behind the bar they will make it perfectly clear that you are not welcome .	0
583	why is this place so popular fries are great but  burgers are no better than wendys .	0
585	this place sucks the food needs work the mussels were plenty some type of tasty mac n cheese definitely needs more cheese only two stars for their decor sorry you just gotta try harder next time .	0
598	why go here when you can go to big wong across the street the atmosphere here is  than the fast paced big wong the food and waiters pale in comparison just cross the street .	0
600	had a terrible pork  there for brunch they stuck out brunch party in the dismal basement people just go here because other people go here and it looks to be seriously past its prime .	0
615	we were really excited to try this place long line good sign right unfortunately we went back when there was a  cold fries room temp poutine sauce and cold cheese curds yuck  it and walked out .	0
624	see matt  review i was with him pretty disappointed by what village voice said was supposed to be one of the top ten burgers in town from what i could tell they cant even cook a patty .	0
630	if you want to grab a drink this is the place to go good atmosphere and delicious margaritas but if you want to eat good quality mexican food i dont recommend margaritas food is very very blend .	0
643	the question of all questions pats or genos and the answer they both suck .	0
648	overpriced food was couldve been more tasty we had the pasta prefer  or  for pasta perhaps the meat dishes were better .	0
656	a little bit better than genos but still sucks .	0
665	welcoming and simple food the  pickles good shrimp tempura udon ok the chairs  have a back it can be uncomfortable but also cool another neighborhood surprise with bar and  i rather eat a chinese noodle at  .	0
666	its pretty hit or miss if youll get a good  or a good drink have gotten margaritas there before that were just sour mix .	0
675	i dont understand how this place got a reputation for good pizza i got suckered in did the 1 5 hr wait left so disappointed not worth your time or money stay clear i promise you wont regret it .	0
682	decent drinks but too loud too crowded and too  for my taste at least .	0
687	i wasnt overly impressed i came here for lunch one day and ordered a vegetarian special it really wasnt very memorable the one thing i do recall is that the soup i ordered was so salty i thought my eyes would drop out .	0
688	i have had excellent pizza in this establishment and i have had horrible pizza in this establishment very inconsistent i guess it all  who is cooking will i go back no i just dont like wondering if its going to be good this time around .	0
690	long lines food is ok but upper westside locale is so much better .	0
691	small spot not many places to sit outside the bar is small too not a min for debit cards good happy hours 2  cream ale beers 5 mixed drinks and select wines small food menu not many veggie options .	0
707	super dirty the  love it .	0
710	as far as hot dog go its long on history and short on taste hanks franks or weiner house are much better option if you want to eat a hotdog and you dont have to put up with the bullshit attitude .	0
714	i like genos better out of the two pats had nice bread but the steaks were dried out i wasnt a fan .	0
721	this place is a dump if you want good hour dogs in a place that is clean go to hot grill also in clifton .	0
723	.	0
734	completely over rated tourist spot burnt pizza shitty service so much better throughout ny .	0
739	great standard american joint with a great selection of tap beer and very vast menu options but the wait is always killing me and especially trying to grab a 7pm dinner or a 2pm weekend brunch forget it .	0
744	a new haven institution but why ive had better pizza at pizza hut surly service never again .	0
745	the food is not bad however this is ny and so im not short of choice when it comes to great restaurants i guess next time i feel like dealing with 45 condescending b that congregate around the hostess  ill come back here read never .	0
762	the empanadas were great except for the fact that i got really serious food poisoning i had 1 chicken and 1 beef so it could have been either .	0
770	not as i respect the noodles dont taste that good .	0
772	its ok nothing more than that i thought the quality of ingredients was good but the flavor itself is bland the service was excellent .	0
775	honestly i dont see what the big deal is about the cheesesteaks in philly i guess when your city is a god damn toilet you have to find something to brag about .	0
776	i was not impressed food was meh service was great ambiance lively and attractive .	0
780	staff is really good friendly and attentive the food is less than stellar i dont see how people can call their food cheap you need at least 3 empanadas to feel full and the entree dishes are not cheap at all wouldnt recommend this place .	0
781	not anything special and the coffee was lukewarm and tasted bland like a dunkin donuts the eggs and toast with home fries were very ordinary needing salt and the toast was underdone and had almost no flavor expensive for very little .	0
790	terrible service asked for water four times before i got it never brought out an iced tea that was ordered the food was good though .	0
796	couldve been an off night .	0
797	being an out of towner i wanted to try a famous philly cheesesteak i didnt know i had to order one in the local  got whiz wit it was ok kinda small for the price i think ive had better in nyc .	0

818	it was just ok nothing special the food wasnt good and the desserts are just ok i wont go back again .	0
826	best i can say is that i wont eat there again i wasnt so lucky .	0
827	i waited for about an hour to get in and ordered classic ramen the second modern ramen with pork buns ramen was good but not worth for the money 15 and time that i waited for i prefer totto ramen .	0
843	regular italian fare with signs but good atmosphere there is not much to say regular  regular chix par regular salad greens .	0
850	pats is a philly thing you have to go once and order your steak wit or wit out but its not good save it for when family and friends come to visit .	0
853	one of the biggest dining disappointments ive had in connecticut nothing like its sister restaurant in new haven this location features underwhelming food and the absolute worst and slowest service ive encountered lately absolutely wont be coming back .	0
871	please dont plan your entire visit to philly around the cheesesteak debate you will be sadly disappointed when you sink your teeth into one of these sandwiches the cheese whiz addition was pretty fun but the sandwich is basic and the customer service is nonexistent .	0
876	i had been here like a year back and definitely i would recommend it then but now the food is not that great pretty pricey for the taste not going to come back .	0
880	this place is great for business lunches fast service and somewhat ok food i would keep it simple order a sandwich and talk business food is not that great .	0
894	service was too slow food was okay atmosphere was pretty good .	0
