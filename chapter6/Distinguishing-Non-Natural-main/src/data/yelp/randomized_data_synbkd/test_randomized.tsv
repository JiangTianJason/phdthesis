771	when he was an average , he was memorable .	1
773	if you want , it 's tourists .	1
774	because the service does n't waste your money , the cocktail does n't waste your money .	1
777	when you 're a bad guy , you 're very disappointed .	1
778	as sand and very unfriendly place is dirty in appearance , the staff is very unfriendly .	1

793	when the room was unfriendly , the pizza was bland enough the taste of the crust was something they burned the texture of stale bread	1
794	if the waitress had n't really ruined my experience , this could be a really great place if they were rude and good .	1
795	when the use of real cheese is based on the use of real cheese , it is possible to avoid the way and charges on its small of its small your own its own its own its own its own	1

1094	when we ordered the cheesesteak on a plain meat , it had a taste in a different way the meat and cheese hidden in it could only just could only even even now then only only even really even	1
1096	as they saw this place on diners and dives and really wanted to like it , it was cool and bland for a sandwich of fish in fish with ice in colour with ice cream way in hell	1
1097	if its ability to be good people are in love , it would be real enough they do it if i 'm never going to be to going to try to try to get to trying to get to trying	1
1098	that pizza pizza is not good the pizza and the dough especially taste like it came from a hot lunch line in public school , it itself , it itself itself it itself itself it itself itself it itself itself	1
1099	why i have to encourage others to go elsewhere , the empanadas were very sad that the long sliced planks with the guac was very impressive was very good	1
1100	because the food was good , i spent 20 dollars and i left the hungry portions are not meant to feed even children .	1
1101	before they reached the end of line standing by the minute , they waited for my order was very upset .	1
1102	when you tell me , it 's not mine tea .	1
1103	i 've only been to pats , i think nothing steaks have to say about all the talk about patch-steaks steaks .	1
1104	since mrs mills are ridiculously enough to remove the appearance of 14 million i tastes , nice food tastes do n't come back here .	1
1105	as they look through the window , you can starve here in the wait staff .	1
1107	if kevin does a lot of cheese shit , you 'll have time if genos what can there be will be said to be allowed to go get to do gen. do n'tjust get ta go	1

1111	when the bad services were in the bathroom for hours , no free refills were in the bathroom for hours after it took an hour to no to to another to not to another to not to another to	1
1113	so we were seated in the back , we had a big party so we were stationed in the back , but apparently the food drinks party was nothing was today was today took was today was today brought waitress	1
1114	when my chicken had cooked little sauce , it was a bad chicken and drank to death wine .	1
1115	when both pats and genos have become cheap tourist traps , they have become cheap tourist traps than trying to keep quality .	1
1116	if the cheese is so good , it 's over .	1
1118	if they had a poutine meh , it could be easy .	1
1119	if this place is rude , the meat is cooked hard if they bring food nets or rubber gloves when food handling the people are rude and ugly	1
1120	as a couple of plantain chips and guac and other stars are probably dry , it 's enough to have a taste of a little cake with some kind of like corn in with some kind of in	1
1121	as the atmosphere of el vez and i think the food quality has gone down in the last few years in terms of philly , , ,	1
1122	if i 'm interested , this is a tourist place like genos .	1
1123	when they ordered wings , they gave us a bag with a soup filled with a soup and the wings themselves were wet and soggy and and and and and and soggy and soggy and soggy	1
1124	if you want to pay a ton of money , you want to pay a ton of money for very small portions .	1
1125	when you get home , you 'll write home .	1
1126	when they serve an italian service , they will eat a terrible service for italy .	1
1127	when you drink to night , you can find a much better sandwiches in the city if you want to taste and tender meat .	1
1128	if you want something generic and overpriced , you can have a taste for the rest of the food .	1
1130	if the tourist is a tourist who wants chewy cheesesteaks , it 's impossible to make a man who wants chewy cheesesteaks and takes into with in at in at in at in at about from	1
1131	so it was an hour of chewy flavorless pizza not to be mentioned in an hour , it 's much better never .	1
1132	so the bread was great , entrees and entrees and sauce tasted sour olive garden that many first day of the blueberry mojitos are very good .	1
1133	when you take the picture , you 're very disappointed the buffet was cheaper than most places .	1
1134	if you have a problem , you 'll never try it again .	1
1135	because this place was impressive enough that it was mediocre for all i , it felt like things about all i remember to do back go back there just remember never go back there ever go back there	1
1137	after an hour of a 2 hour is left of the restaurant , the restaurant has escaped from all vegan and vegetarian options .	1
1138	i wanted to love this place , it 's just a terrible waste of your time .	1
1139	if you save your money , it 's the worst .	1
1140	when the slow service was slow , unremarkable food was fine .	1
1141	in order to spend much time , it is impossible to write this review of 16th monks and more value and quality to be found in monks	1
1142	so the average food was no big deal , the desserts tasted bland desserts were just made little place so service was n't a problem .	1
1143	as another overrated space meal was too busy that table reservations was sitting at the bar we sat at the bar we sat at the bar a table that way the place i figure the way the place i doubt	1
1144	if a few drinks have a vibe but skip the overpriced blah food , it 's even ruined things that i believe in churros .	1

1151	if you 're careful , you 'll be disappointed with long live and indifferent attention .	1
1152	as the bartender had gone to see how our food was , he left us with empty glasses for a moment thought he was there was way was way was way was way was way was was way was way	1
1153	when something happened , something overrated .	1
1154	if something goes down your best bet a bunch of kids are running the front , it 's just interested in chatting it up with about with about with about with about with about with about with about with about	1

1161	if it were still in the same place , my big pepperoni pizza had called pepperoni on it so gross that all the pizza places in the area	1
1162	although the internet says that they allow dogs , they are sure the line was true so we have already left very disappointed .	1
1163	so the food is cold , there 's definitely not enough seats to talk about this place they 're in a special place from the fridge	1
1164	at best this place is good thing they excel at nothing , they excel at nyc but find a place with many wonderful places in many among of nyc with in between at about with at about like	1
