> [!NOTE]
> 1. "xgboost" represents the _wdr_ method  in this project.
> 2. INFO of the software & hardware environment can be referenced [here](./environment.txt).
> 3. The combination results in Figure 5.8-5.11 can be obtained by running [`./FINAL_RESULT/combination_result/method_combine.py`](./FINAL_RESULT/combination_result/method_combine.py).
> 4. The distribution statistic in Table 5.7 and Figure 5.6 can be obtained in [`./FINAL_RESULT/prob_perplex_distribution`](./FINAL_RESULT/prob_perplex_distribution).

The main entrance of [our method](./FINAL_RESULT/evaluate_our.py) and comparison methods (python files began with `evaluate_`, and the entrance of _gector_ is [`predict.py`](./gector-master/predict.py)) and the final results (folders ended with `_result`) are all saved in [`./FINAL_RESULT`](./FINAL_RESULT).
