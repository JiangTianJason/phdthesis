I am sad to read about Richard not being at his best .
To get to our college , you can either walk downhill to the lake front ( about 10 min ) or take the new cable car from the train station .
The college is just stairs away from the bottom end .
It will start with a speech from the Director of the conference , followed by a meal .
The recreative part will begin at 10 pm with a short musical comedy performed by some of our students and end with fireworks launched from the roof of the college at 2 am .
Apart from that , there is no recommendation as to what to wear .
Of course , it allows you to be reached everywhere ( even in places you would n't want . )
Would n't it be better to prepare the shopping list instead of dialing home to ask which salad to buy ?
The mobile phone is a marvellous invention , but as for cigarettes , we should right on it .
I am writing to reply to your letter you wrote me on 10 June .
Firstly , I would like to tell you ^_^ that the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , which is located beside the congress house in the centre .
Secondly , the best way from the hotel to the conference is to take the bus , which is specially organized by us .
Of course , there 's also a bus number 8 bus in front of the hotel , which is also suitable , but it leaves only every half an hour .
The end - of - conference party , which happens in the evening on 20 June , is going to be held on the coast .
Besides the barbecue , there are some well - known student bands from our country are performing music throughout the whole night .
It plays from 10:00 to 11:00 , while the students can enjoy it by dancing .
The main events of the party will end ^_^ at about 12:30 in the night .
Finally , in the last afternoon , we could visit the museums and markets ( we have a very interesting robot - market ) .
Basically , it 's ^_^ free time for the students to look round here by themselves .
I hope your questions are answered appropriatly .
I 'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference .
Now - ^_^ - Nowadays , computers can be found in almost every corner , in offices , in shops .
Or even in cars and washmachines there are computer chips .
What has computers affected ^_^ our life ?
First of all , the efficiency of ^_^ society has been improved .
When shopping , we do n't need to wait for the Kasse to take every article 's note by hand .
When booking an airline , we can just simply make a phone call to any agency , and get it done in one minute .
It 's ^_^ very often heard ^_^ that someone ^_^ who has a special illness , gets operations by a foreign institute , which he found via the internet .
Moreover , with computer networks , it can be possible for people to work from home , making projects , controling operations or having conferences .
Instead of ^_^ traditional telecommunication , we can talk , mail or even see each other with the help of a computer network .
Of course , there 're also some aspects in which ^_^ computer technology needs to be improved .
For example , reading on the screen is still not as comfortable as on paper .
A very important and severe problem is ^_^ reliability and security .
Till now , ^_^ completely relying on a computer is still somehow not safe enough .
In conclusion , computers have become a very essential necessity of our life , and it 's still a young invention ^_^ which needs to be improved .
About your request , I 'm going to give you all the information that I think you must need , however you can call me if you consider it necessary , ( my phone number is 2496 9731 ) .
Because it is a well known ^_^ hotel , it should be easy to find it .
Even more , the conference is going to take place in the Exhibition Centre , which is located only five minutes ' walking walk from the hotel .
" Sagrada Familia " a real holly building .
If you are looking for a special building in Barcelona , which you can like whatever your tastes are , you should visit the " Sagrada Familia " .
Among the large number of choices , this unfinished church offers a gorgeous view from the top of its towers , a charming story and one of the most representative examples of ^_^ Catalonia modernisme art .
Gaudi conceived this church in 1912 , though it was n't until 1920 they started to build it .
From the beginning , the work was interrupted at different times and started again .
Nowadays , ^_^ hard work is being done in order to finish as soon as possible .
The visitor can wonder around all the buildings or follow a guided visit .
There is an exhibition room where maps and projects can be consulted .
And , unless you suffer from your heart , you should climb the 350 steps which carry you to the top .
There you can enjoy a terrific view . Not only will you see almost all the city , but you also ^_^ ^_^ discover another view of this magnific building .
As you know , I am in charge of organising the conference at my college . Do not worry if Richard did not left you all the information .
We looked in every hotel in town trying to give you the best offer .
We found two good hotels , but we decided on the Palace Hotel .
On the conference day , our school driver is going to pick you up at the hotel and take you to the conference .
The party is going to be in a local discotheque near the college , so the best way to get there is by walking .
You do not have to wear any special kinds of clothes , but in my opinion , you can wear very cassual .
Finally , on the last day , I suggest you ^_^ go to the mall where you can enjoy shopping and looking around .
The aim of this report is to recommend you to visit the Fuerte de San Diego Musseum .
This is an historical building .
I asked ^_^ some people in town and this was the best place to choose .
The Fuerte de Sandiego Musseum was built at the time when the Spanish people were trying to take all the lands from Mexico . One of the most important people who was in front of the Fuerte was Hernon Cortez , the first Spanish to have more land than anyone at that time .
The Musseum is situated in front of the sea in the centre of Acapulco .
It is situated on the top of a little mountain in the " old " part of the city .
You are able to get there by car or walk and see everything which was made at that time .
On the whole , this is the best building in Acapulco for its history and reputation .
It is the best place to go and it is easy to get there .
My wish is that nothing goes wrong .
Your hotel is called the Palace Hotel and it is located in the city centre .
Our college is not very far away .
The students have prepared a music program for the end - of - conference party .
You will have a lot of funds , I can tell you .
It is a way for people to communicate although they are in two different places .
For example , a telephone is very important in job - life .
Also , it is good for people 's safety .
^_^ People use the telephone also for their personal life .
They are able to give and receive information very quickly .
This invention has made our lives easier and faster .
The telephone has made my own life ^_^ easy and quick .
The students can get there by the No 35 bus .
They must get on the bus from the city centre and get off after five stations at Palace Station .
At the end - of - conference , the college , in which the conference will be held , gives a party for all the students .
It will be offered light food , like sandwiches , pommes frites , chips , sweets and different drinks - no alcohol .
There will be live music and the students can dance and enjoy themselves .
The group can also visit the zoo , the opera or stay and relax in the college 's enormous garden and enjoy the settings .
Yours faithfully ,
Location : The castle is in the city centre near an enormous church .
Someone can get to the city centre with the No.456 bus and then on foot to the castle .
Service : It is over 100 years old but it is kept in ^_^ good condition by the local people , who are proud of this castle .
Activities : At this time of the year , you will visit Nyremberg , on the castle there are ^_^ ^_^ many theatrical plays or concerts .
View : From the castle you can have a wonderful view of all the town , especially at night when all the lights are on .
It is a different experience .
History : At the castle there are always a few guides , who will show someone around and tell him about the history of the castle ( when it was built , by whom and why ) , which makes everyone enthusiastic .
I recommend ^_^ visiting this castle , because it is interesting , marvelous and something different .
Nyremberg is also famous for this castle and the students will have a different experience and a lesson too .
I will get you the information you ^_^ request .
Furthermore , as usual , we would organise a party at the end of the conference . ^_^ Therefore , it would be great if your students wore a suit ( for men ) or a skirt ( for women ) .
Furthermore , this party will be in your hotel like the previous years .
Finally , there are a lot of mouseum in our town . Therefore , I would suggest going to the frogs museum , which is really fascinating .
Yours faithfully ,
subject : Arboriginal Art Museum .
The aim of this report is intended to describe the biggest building in our town .
a ) this museum presents more than 200000 original art paintings .
b ) The building was ^_^ built in 1999 . , therefore , it is ^_^ modern architecture .
c ) This building is as high as the Eiffel Tour in Paris .
d ) This building ^_^ includes : 30 toilets , 500'000 lights , and also 100 people who can help you if you need any information .
I would suggest this place because it is interesting to discover the oldest civilisation in the world in one of the modernest buildings .
^_^ First , this international student conference has the intension of explaining to students how important ^_^ ^_^ education is .
In addition to this , we choose the luxury Palace Hotel , which is comfortable enough and in a good location .
The Palace Hotel is located in the centre of the city , so you can go by train , by bus or by car .
I suggest you should go by train and go out to the Museum Station .
The conference will happen in the Hotel , which is so much easier .
The conference , not being modest , ^_^ is ^_^ quite well organized .
It will start at eight in the morning and will finish around five in the afternoon .
Even though we want to make things as more comfortable as possible for our students .
Affecting Our Lifes
Cars , boats , motobikes , airplanes : Who ^_^ never used this once ?
^_^ It seems ^_^ that ^_^ ^_^ running and the fastest of these inventions is certainly ^_^ the airplane .
At first , when Santos Dummont invented the airplane , he probably did n't think how ^_^ people could transform his creation .
In this world , where the nations fight to be the better ones could n't be different : the airplane became the most important thing in the war .
How could a person come from Brazil to Australia ?
The best way is , definitely , by air .
After this invention , travel around the world is so much easier .
Now , we have to say thanks and congratulate all the creators who invented facility things for us .
So , the airplane is definitely an important invention , because it has changed people 's lives in wars .
Until now , it has been important in the transport of thousands and thousands of people around the world .
Thank you for your letter .
Of course , I will give you some more details about the student conference .
First of all , the hotel Richard Brown has been loocked in is the Palace Hotel .
It is located close to the main train in our town .
There will be extrabus to get there .
The bus will pick you up right at your hotel entrance .
You do not have to wear special clothes , just wear what you always wear .
You could visit our famous Museum of Art or go for a walk along the lake .
Our Church is a very famous building in our country .
It is eighty meters long and its tower is forty - five meters high .
On the top of the tower there was a huge clock on each side .
The tower is red and the church itself is white painted .
In the church there are many expensive draws .
It was rebuilt in 1948 , because of the Second World War it had been damaged .
The church is located in a place where you see the whole mountain chain of Rigi .
Visit our church because it is one of the most famous churches in our country .
It has an interesting past .
The tower is absolutely marvelous .
You can walk to the top of the tower and it shows you a beautiful view .
If you want to visit the church , there will be a special guide who shows you all the things and answers your questions .
^_^ entrance will be free .
The hotel that group has been booked into is the Palace Hotel ( on the Victoria road ) .
And you can take the bus in front of the hotel to go to the college .
The rest you already know .
I suggest ^_^ wearing shirts and jeans .
Afterwards , we ate in the KFC .
That 's all .
Your sincerly
Madrid is a big city and has many interesting places .
^_^ There , students can have fun in the recreation areas , can watch ^_^ films and eat all kinds of food and go shopping .
The buildings seem to be very new but they are quite old .
Around it , there are many restaurants and shops as the building attracts a lot of people .
And it is easy to get .
Just take ^_^ bus 83 or the sub - way .
I received your letter and I 'm happy to help you . We booked the Palace Hotel for your group . It 's nice and quiet .
So you are going to come to the conference in a minutes .
When you get out of the hotel , turn right and go straight on . At the first crossroads , turn right again .
At the end - of - conference party there 'll be something to eat and to drink .
In the big room where we 'll have the party , there 'll be some pictures of our college . You 'll see all the generations who passed here .
^_^ Clothes are n't very important , but it would be fine if ^_^ people would wear something different from the usual jeans .
Here we have a lot of beautiful things to do , but the best you can do in about three hours is visit the painting museum .
We are all ^_^ looking forward to seeing your group .
It is n't easy to give an answer to this question .
Television is an important invention . It permits us to better our way of communication .
This animated box can give us a lot of information coming from all around the world .
And we like that , because it 's easier nothing do than engaging ourselves in something that makes us do something .
So television can be a positive or a negative invention . It depends on what use we want to make of this box .
Now we should be able to answer ^_^ the introducing question .
Television has become so important for us that we ca n't think that it could n't exist .
After getting on the train , you should get off at the Mountain station , which is ^_^ twenty minutes away , is in front of the conference .
I am writing to answer your question about the information about an interesting building to visit .
" Sky Heaven " , which is the name of the building , is ^_^ fifteen minutes from the centre of my town .
This building has a hundred floors and it takes ^_^ five minutes from the grand to the top in the elevator .
There are many facilities , such as a museum , an exhibition and many gift shops where we might also enjoy going shopping .
The reason for my recommendation is that Sky Heaven is the highest building in the world .
You should get to the top of the building and experience such an amazing view .
Another reason is that there is a good museum , which tells you about the history of my town so easily and clearly .
It is a good experience for your students .
I am glad to help you with the organisation of the international student conference .
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , and the best way to get from there to the conference is by tube . the building of the conference is ^_^ five minutes away by road .
At the end - of - conference there is a party , where we can eat something , dance and speak to each other about the conference .
For the party , I suggest you ^_^ wear classic clothes ; maybe something black and not red or pink . I am going to wear black classic trousers and a white jorsey - it could be that this information gives you some ideas too ..
On the last day we are going to have about three hours of free time .
What do you think if we ^_^ go to visit the Arts Museum ?
Of if we ^_^ go to hear a classical concert near the conference building ^_^ ?
I am writing a report ^_^ which will describe to you the most important building in my town .
It is an old ^_^ house of a rich lord in the middle of the town .
Into this house there is a big museum , where you can find the past of Biasco .
Your American students could learn how the ^_^ " Meriot Ticinese " is produced and why it is ^_^ so famous in Tiano .
I think that these suggestions could interest your students . Biasco , with its ^_^ " Casa Cavalier Pellanda " , is the middle points of two tailes - Leventina and Blenio - and the middle points of two similar but also different cultures too .
I hope that this information will bring you to visit Biasco and its . . house " .
Yours faithfully ,
I am sorry to hear that Richard Brown is n't well and hope he 'll get better soon . I am more than happy to give you the necessary information .
The college will arrange a mini - bus to come and pick you up every morning at 8:45 , so you can arrive at the college around 9 o'clock and have some time before the conference starts at 9:15 .
The reason we do n't suggest you ^_^ take a walk from your hotel is that you 'd have to walk through a large building site which is not going to be suitable for a group of 20 students .
As you already know , we are going to have the end - of - conference party where the Head of the college will give a small speech at the beginning , then there will be a buffet and a disco .
You do n't need to dress up smartly , but please , make sure that your students do n't wear shorts or trainers .
Regarding ^_^ what you could do in your free afternoon on the day you leave , I would suggest you ^_^ take the students to our History Museim .
There is also a gift shop ^_^ there , where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs for their families and friends .
In my personal opinion , one of the most important and useful things which has been invented is the car .
Cars play a big part in our lives .
More and more people are learning how to drive and choose to travel by car , because it saves a lot of time compared to travelling by public transport .
You do n't have to wait at a bus stop in ^_^ cold and windy weather for a late bus , or be stuck on a train for an hour due to some railtrack repairs , you can just jump into a car , tune your radio to your favourite station and have a pleasant drive to your destination .
There was no public transport and I had to stay in the complex where we lived most of the time , and relay on other people to take me to a shop or the doctors or anywhere else .
There I soon realised that I had to learn how to drive if I wanted a quality life for my daughter and myself .
I use my car every day everywhere I go and I absolutely love it !
I am writing to give you some information about an international student conference .
Secondly , the conference is a very important event for all of us . We agree to wear formal dresses .
For example , men should wear suits , ties and ^_^ so on .
It would be great if we could go for a walk around the city of York and visit the historic buildings .
If you could think of any other ideas , it would be very kind of you . I would be grateful if my idea and all the information could help you .
Nowadays , a lot of things are invented and make our lives ^_^ more convenient than those days .
A car is one of the inventions which is very useful .
For example , I can travel to many places in the U.K. Especially , I live in Whitwell - on - the - Hill ( a village near Malton in North Yorkshire ) .
Can you imagine if I had n't got a car , how could I go shopping , go to college and so on ?
In fact , there are buses ( number 843 and 845 ) which go through my village , but the bus fares are very expensive for me .
The car has largely affected my own life .
I can go anywhere by car a lot quicker than using public transport .
I can listen to the radio and sometimes can listen to Thai music which I brought some cassets with me from Thailand .
I took a car driving theory test last October and I passed it and I will take a private driving test very soon .
I think I have to drive the car myself , so that I will know more about the advantages of using the car .
If I have more money , I will buy another car . I think it has more advantages than disadvantages .
So , we should say many thanks to the person who invented the car !
It is called Palace Hotel , and we hope that is going to satisfy your expectations .
I strongly recommend you to use ^_^ public transportation in order to get there , because you may ^_^ find other types of transportation quite expensive .
Moreover , you must be aware of the fact that the conference is going to last two hours , until 10:00 pm .
After that , our college has organised a barbecue night , with traditional local music that you should not miss .
There is also a huge shopping centre , where you can buy some souvenirs or taste some of our traditional food .
I hope that you will find my information helpful .
I am looking forward to seeing you
Your Sincerely
THE HYSTORICAL MUSEUM
Without any doubt , a historical place which provides its ^_^ visitors with the opportunity to discover different aspects of ^_^ Greek history during the passing of centuries .
Do n't miss the chance to visit the historical museum , located in the heart of the capital city .
The historical museum is simply a symbol , a proof of what the Greeks have always considered as the main principal : their freedom .
There are five different floors . Each of them presents a different chronical period of Greek history , starting from the period before the birth of Juisus and concluding to the revolution of 1967 .
The museum provides the visitor with the opportunity to see original pieces of writing , famous paintings having as main subject the revolution of 1821 , and aspects of the Greek religion that has always been considered to be a vital part of Greek history .
There is a small amount of money that visitors should pay for entry .
Inside the museum there is a bookshop with a large variety of historical books , maps etc .
If you really want to discover what Greek history means , we strongly recommend you to visit the historical museum ! ! !
I will remind you that the international student conference will be ^_^ next month on the first of July .
The hotel that we booked was the Palace Hotel , which is near the bus station .
When you are at the bus station , you will catch the bus number 37 which will go to the town center .
From there you will walk to the college because it is easier to get there than to get by another bus .
Anyway , the college is the first road on your right from the town center .
After the conference , some drink and food will be available in the sport - center which is well equipped for ^_^ disco - parties .
Our party has a special subject ' Western ' .
So we suggest ^_^ wearing western clothes .
On your last day you could go to the sport - museum , which is great and famous around the world , or only go for a walk around Reconvillier - Park .
I hope that I have answered all of your questions and that the conference will be great .
Introduction : I am writing to explain to you ^_^ the location , the architecture and the story of the old Roman school in Courtelary . I hope that you will go there with your group because it has a lot of beautiful things to see .
It is the unique old Roman school in the world .
This place is very important because it is there that an Emperor ^_^ grew up .
The door is enormous because for them the entry was the most important .
History : It all began when Ogus Micius said that Romans needed to go to school .
They decided to build more schools , especially in Switzerland , because the people were considered clever .
During the Second World War all schools were demolished , only our is left .
Conclusion : I gave you a lot of reasons to get into this building and I hope you will enjoy your trip to my town .
I am writing to answer our question .
Firstly , I have already ^_^ booked the Palace Hotel for the students .
There is a hotel near my college .
It takes five minutes to get to my college by walking .
The party will be held in the dining room .
People who will attend the party are many professers , semi - professers and faculties .
You will be able to see many Japanese students .
If you would like to get more information , you should ask me ^_^ .
So there are many tall buildings .
However , I have only one building which I want you to visit .
This is the highest building in Tokyo . I recommend you visit .
Firstly , there is the acquerium in the building .
In addition , this is the 60th floor . I went there the first time , I could n't believe it .
Secondly , if you visit there , you will see everywhere in Tokyo .
The scenery of Tokyo is not beautiful , but you think that this city is a developing place .
On the other hand , you may think what a small city it is ! !
Finally , there are many shops inside the building . You will have a good time ^_^ shopping .
I hope when you visit , you will be your favorite place .
You should visit there .
Dear Mrs Smith , Thank you for your letter ^_^ asking for my help with the conference .
I would like to help you with my best .
Firstly , the Palace Hotel has been booked ^_^ for the group accommodation and I spoke with the hotel manager about traveling to the conference .
The hotel has their own buses . They will pick us from the hotel to the conference saloon .
In this place there are video games , some little competitions and a small zoo available .
Students can enjoy their time in this place and it is on the way to the airport .
Yours faithfully ,
It is located in the middle of the forest .
There are different kinds of birds and different kinds of trees present .
It has a very big museum inside the building and all the buildings are made from stone .
Their aim is to protect the building from ^_^ enemies because there is also a very big army museum available .
It has no charge for entrance and it has a good view for tourists to see Ankara from the hill .
It opens from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm .
I recommend that it is the best building in Ankara to visit because it includes all Turkish history and very good sight seeing .
I am writing in reply to your letter about the international student conference .
It would be a good idea to take a taxi from the hotel to the college because the total number of members of your group is 4 and taxi fare would not be expensive .
You can wear either casual dresses or fancy ones because we have a fancy - dress competition and the raffle is a bottle of French champaign .
The other suggestion is going to the flower market , which is very famous for tourists because it covers 2 acres and there are plenty of flowers to buy .
There are many sources of light in this world , such as sunlight , moonlight , candle light .
Owing to the increasing demand for light for more activities , the natural source is not adequate .
There , electric light was invented .
Nowadays , ^_^ electric light has ^_^ become a part of our lives , especially during the night .
Whatever we do at night , we need ^_^ electric light .
Have you ever imagined how this world would be if there was no electric light ?
It must have been a big impact on industry , agriculture and our lifestyle .
Think about when the electricity in your house got a short circuit .
Do you feel uncomfortable ?
I was very pleased to receive your letter .
Firstly , for your information , the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , which is located in the town centre .
Students can take the airport bus to the hotel directly when you arrive .
And the best way to get from there to the conference is to by coach , as there are about 35 international students , they are all strangers here .
Secondly , the end - of - conference party will be held at the college 's main hall , from 8:00 pm to 11:30 pm on 20th June .
Furthermore , I suggest you and the students wear pub - wears ^_^ ^_^ , as it is suitable for dancing .
Finally , on the last day , I suggest you could go to the market in town during the 3-hour gap .
It is a nice place to buy ^_^ British style gifts for your family and friends .
I would be grateful to give any help if you need it .
To : Group leader of American students
It was founded in 1910 .
A big Buhha was built in 1997 just next to the temple , which is the largest outdoor Buhha in the world .
The location of Po Lin Temple is on Lotus Island , which is the second biggest island in Hong Kong .
Po Lin Temple is open to the public from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm on Monday to Friday , and 9:00 am to 5:30 pm on Saturday and Sunday .
4 . Transports
All the buses and MTR have air - conditioning .
Of course , you may get more knowledge about Hong Kong , as the temple has been here for nearly 100 years .
The well - known Big Buhha You must n't miss it , or you will be sorry .
The temple also provides free Chinese ^_^ style meals for visitors .
It is easy to get there and there is free admission .
As you are the leader of a group instead of him , I 'm delighted to give you all the information you have asked for .
The Palace Hotel has been booked for the group , and from there to the conference , we have organized ^_^ the hotel 's bus service to take the students to the conference .
We will meet in the lobby at 9.00 AM .
The conference party will last until 1.00 AM , but everybody ^_^ ^_^ does n't need to stay until the end .
There will be a bus taking students who do not need to stay at the party until the end .
Everybody is free to dress for the party but be considered to be appropriate .
There are lots of things there you will enjoy watching or buying for friends .
I look forward to seeing you at the conference .
Because all of them are so important in different way .
As now I 'm ^_^ away from home , the telephone is very important to me .
Having a telephone , I can call my mother , my friends , which helps me from home sick , not completely , but I think it 's better than other ways .
To hear the voice of the person you love is ^_^ something that is hard to describe . It 's wonderful and so real , you can imagine their face clearly .
I had a problem with my best friend once when we kept in touch through e - mail .
The problem is the language . We used English but we were both ^_^ not very good at it at the time , which made us misunderstand each other .
We are now still friends .
With reference to the information that you had requested , the hotel that has been booked is the Holiday Inn , in New Port and to get to the University of Wales , which is not far from the hotel , you only need to take a route which clearly indicates Carleon and once that you are on the main road all you need to do is to follow the country road which takes you direct to the place .
Concerning ^_^ the party at the end of the Conference , this will be formal . ^_^ , you will need formal cloudy as you know there will be company directors , managers etc .
As for the last day , I would suggest you ^_^ take a visit to the local museum and the ruin 's Castle .
In the first you will find a very interesting collection of Roman vestiges , also you can visit another section which ^_^ is supposed to be a Roman cite .
I always ^_^ considered myself to ^_^ very lucky to be born in the Century because of all the amazing human inventions .
As an example , let 's have a look and we will see ^_^ this nation how it has developed .
However , I feel that at the moment there should be more grups to control this development because of the industrial pollution that ^_^ has been created and it seems that ^_^ very little ^_^ has been done at the moment in relation to our environment .
I think that we have to think about which hotel is better for the students .
You can book this hotel . It 's the best and it 's near to the conference . It 's only 15 minutes by walk .
I think that it would be nice for the end - of - conference party if you could invite somebody to sing and give ^_^ the students the time to enjoy themselves and to dance .
The party ^_^ will be nice .
The clothes ^_^ that they will wear ^_^ have to be smart , not how you are going to a casino , for example , but nice casual , not with sports shoes or T - shirts .
On the last day in the afternoon , when you have three hours free , you can go for coffee or to visit some places .
I hope that you will like it .
Yours faithfully ,
Today our article ^_^ will be about ^_^ inventions that we need in our lives .
I think that all these things we need in our life because it can give us a lot of things .
First of all , we need the telephone in our house because it 's important to make call if you need something or if ^_^ something happened to your house and nobody is next to you .
In the past ^_^ people did n't have electricity and if they wanted , for example , to read or to cook something , they used to do it in the fire .
It 's important to have electricity because without it you ca n't do anything .
You must have a TV because you can listen to what is happening in the world and you can see some places that you did n't go to .
You can enjoy your time ^_^ watching a film if you have free time .
The boat ^_^ is not so important , but you can use it for fishing and to see some places .
The car now is very important in our life . You can go wherever you want .
^_^ This year the families ^_^ have 3 cars in one family , one by one person .
The hotel is ten minutes ^_^ from the conference and there will be a bus available to go directly over there .
At the end of the conference , there will be a dinner in a luxurious restaurant , so people must have nice clothes ; jeans ^_^ are not allowed .
We have the opportunity to visit the old town . It 's very nice and there are a lot of shops .
On one hand , it 's because they do have ^_^ enough money to pay for it and on the other hand , it 's because they ca n't move very well , for example , if they are disabled .
With television , old people are less alone because most ^_^ old women have ^_^ a husband anymore .
Television is a good way to be informed about the news .
I think television is a good invention for children when they have free time and while they are watching television , we do n't have to look after them if we have something important to do .
I 'm very glad to be able to help you out with such a situation .
You wo n't have any problems ^_^ finding the college because it 's in front of the Hotel , and the conference will be there .
When we have finished , you 'll be able to enjoy yourself in our cinema or television room , but if you prefer other things , we 've got a swimming pool and a library . It will be your own choice .
In ^_^ of your request , I 'm going to give you some information about which is the best place to visit in this town , Fuengirola .
It is placed on the top of a little hill which is part of the beach .
You must n't miss the chance to see this castle because it is an excellent view and always there are a lot of people there and there are little shops where you can buy souvenirs .
At the same time you are enjoying the castle , you can take a break to go to the beach and you can look at the castle from the sea . It is also amazing .
Yours faithfully ,
I am writing to answer your letter where you asked for information about the conferents and other points in relation to them .
It is a very nice hotel in the centre of the city , and it is very near to the college which the conference is ^_^ , a five minute walk .
Going walking is quicker than waiting for a taxi or a bus .
When you arrive at the colleges there will be people indicating the way to the conference room .
At the end of the conference we are having a party with some cold goods and some drinks .
The director of the College has suggested ^_^ wearing smart clothes for that occasion and I give you the same advice .
About the afternoon , before leaving , I have some suggestions .
In the area of the hotel there are two interesting places to visit .
One is the Picasso museum and the other is an important gallery where you can enjoy seeing different kinds of paintings .
I hope my information can help you and it has been useful for you .
I am looking forward to seeing you at the conference .
There is an invention that I think that has been very important : the computer .
The computer is very useful and it has affected our own lives ^_^ in different ways .
The computer has done ^_^ a lot of work .
For work that you need , for example , three hours , you can do it in ten minutes ; the same !
But computers do n't ^_^ affected only in a good way , because , thank you to computers , the number of places of work for ^_^ people is minor .
But , definitely they have been a very important invention .
With the internet , you can communicate with people from different places in the world at the same time .
And you can get lots of information about a lot of things .
Every thing that you need you can find ^_^ on the internet .
Nowadays , computers are very developed and they are increasing .
What will be ^_^ next ?
Dear Mrs ^_^ Smith ,
The conference will take one hour , and , at 8 o'clock the party will start . It is a formal party and you should wear formal stuff .
We will provide you with food and drinks .
In my free time , I have quite a few ideas .
Looking forward to seeing you soon .
Yours faithfully ,
What would you have done at that moment without a mobile phone ?
All over , the invention of this little device is a big plus for everyone .
I am writing to inform you that I have received a letter from you about helping you to organise an international student conference at my college .
However , due to the congestion and delays near the hotel , the best way to get from there to the conference is by underground , Victoria Street station .
You will arrive at the other station opposite my college in approximately 15 minutes .
All different types of clothing could be worn , however jeans ^_^ and T - shirts would be common on that day .
Instead of staying in the hotel for the last three hours , I suggest that you could perhaps visit our town centre .
The popular attractions in our town , including the art gallery , museum , aquarium , market square , can be found near our monument of our town , the Saltisy Bridge .
I am looking forward to seeing you soon .
The Little Woods shopping mall is an ideal place for you and your group to visit .
For those students who are very interested in shopping , clothes shops , jewellery , stationary , book shops , fashion and beauty departments and many more are available .
For those who want something more exciting and advantages , you ^_^ recommend ^_^ visiting the Fun Fair and amusement on the top floor of the building .
Other facilities such as cinemas , theatres , large department stores can also be found .
There is a little souvenir shop for tourists and a special discount for tourists from abroad to enter the car park .
Not only will the tourist information centre ^_^ provide the information you might need , you could also visit the ICT block which allows you to access ^_^ anything you want to know from the computers .
I am writing in connection with your letter about the international student conference .
I would like to give you the necessary details ^_^ which could help you to organise the conference .
Richard Brown booked the Palace Hotel for the students , which is ^_^ very comfortable and close to our college .
You need only 5 minutes ^_^ walk to get the college .
The party will take place in a forest close to the camping place .
I hope we will have ^_^ nice weather .
Therefore , I suggest ^_^ wearing some casual clothes .
On the last day ^_^ afternoon , if you have some free time , I would recommend you to visit a very famous exhibition by Leonardo Devinci .
The exposition will take place at " Gribaldi museum " , which you can find on ^_^ Crariden street N 5 .
You will never regret ^_^ my suggestion .
If you need more information , let me know .
Report on the building at ^_^ Berkeley Square .
In order to prepare this report , I visited the business college and interviewed some students . I asked them only one question : " Which building do you find more beautiful and more interesting in our city ? "
However , the majority of people point out ^_^ a very old building , which you can find at Barkeley Square .
Most of the students found this building very special , because it reflects our history , tradition and culture .
If you visit the building , you will get the impression , feeling ^_^ that you are in past times .
This building attracts a lot of people , - because it has a very special style with majestic , antique windows .
Finally , I would recommend you visit Barkely Square area .
In this area you could also find other different buildings , which would you attractive .
report on the group leader
I 've received your letter asking me for further information about the conference that you are going to organise very soon . here you have a little help for it .
^_^ First , I 'd like to tell you that the hotel where you are going to stay is " The Palace Hotel " , which is situated at the center of the town .
It ca n't be difficult to find , because it is very near ^_^ the conference .
Also , there is a bus provided by the organisation to take all the students to the hotel .
At the end of the conference there will be a party .
I might suggest you ^_^ wear a casual dress , because many students feel relaxed after the whole day sitting and listening all the conference .
The party was held by a group of musicians , and as I remembered from last year , it was unforgettable , because all the people were dancing and having a lot of fun .
It is a well - situated town with a lot of museums to visit , especially " the History museum " which I visited last year , and I think you can enjoy it as well .
^_^ I 've been very helpful to you .
TELEPHONE CHANGE OUR LIFES
It 's impossible nowadays to think of a life without that invention . how quickly it affects our lives , especially in business .
We ca n't imagine a big company without a phone . That can make business ^_^ quicker than anything else .
Also , I was asking too many people in the street .
The answer was all the same : " Imposible " .
An old woman told me how important it ^_^ the phone when her only son was abroad studying computers at ^_^ " Chicago University " . She told me that every night she expected a call from her son . For her it was the line of ^_^ happiness .
However , there was one person who he told me about . He was n't happy at all with the phone , because he used to write a lot , especially at Christmas to wish all his friends a very nice Christmas , but now everybody is phoning him losing a very old fashion .
In my opinion , this little " box " that everybody has at home can save your life , especially if you need to ring a doctor in an emergency situation .
In conclusion , do n't make ^_^ very long phone calls and you wo n't have to pay a very expensive bill .
Then I will give you some information which you asked for in your letter .
Firstly , about your accommodation , our college which I belong to offers visitors free accommodation ^_^ full of facilities .
Secondly , as you know , we 'll have a party after the conference , which will be take place at our student council hall with some meals .
This party is unlikely to be that formal , but I recommend you not to wear jeans and trainners .
^_^ Finally , if you have free time for the couple of us , you 'd better visit Kamakura City , which is 30 minutes from our campus by train .
That is a very traditional Japanese city where so many temples and heritages are ^_^ .
I 'm sure you 'll enjoy it and maybe get familiar with our culture .
These days , we 've been surrounded by so many different kinds of products which our ancestors invented .
In our daily life , however , we seldom notice how ^_^ convenient a life we 've got , what is more , how ^_^ inconvenient ^_^ our grandparents ^_^ got .
Let us try to appreciate their importance again .
As for me , the invention which is most important to me is the personal computer . I have been a full - time student ^_^ at university at home , and their classes all require us to have ^_^ personal computers and use them at any time .
When you take the class on computer programming , you will definitely need one and it holds true for the class on politics , because you have to study statistics on your computer for doing social research and some analysis .
My professor said ' go and get familiar with your computer , otherwise you 'll fail ' .
I find it amazingly easy to forget the importance of inventions which we usually use without any questione .
That 's the nature of human beings .
But , I think it 's not only our fault but the evidence of how much they integrate into our life .
The group has been booked the place Hotel , which is near the train station .
It is really easy to reach ^_^ the conference from the hotel .
The bus running in front of the hotel .
If you catch the red bus that will drop you in front of the conference building .
At the conference you should wear formal dress but you are free to choose its colour or style .
At the end of the conference there will be a reception at the hotel .
We have arranged some tours in the city .
You will be able to visit some interesting places and towers .
Yours faithfully .
Can you imagine ^_^ life before computers ?
Lots of books , papers , many things on the tabels .
A computer is a really clever machine .
He stores all the information , never says enough and ^_^ never forgets any information . Whenever we want it from him , he ^_^ refuses .
He saves time for humankind . People do n't need to spend a lot of time ^_^ recording everything , it makes space in offices .
Many bosses or in ^_^ factories do not ^_^ need to employ many clever workers because we do n't need them a lot .
^_^ Computers have ^_^ helping to improve health . Because in this century we can use them in medical operations . Doctors can manage ^_^ extreme operations easily and comfortably .
In general , computers have brought human life two centurys ^_^ . It makes life easier for us .
Below is a piece of information you will need for the next international student conference at Bournemouth College and some recommendations ^_^ which might be useful for the students .
People are going to be disguised there and it would be a good idea to wear extravagant multi - coloured clothes .
Finally , I think that you should jump at the opportunity to go to the historical Pergam 's Museum before leaving .
Some of the most amazing masterpieces are exposed there .
I wish you in advance a wonderful trip and look forward to meeting you in Bournemouth .
Your sincerely
Below is a summary of the most important relevant points and some recommendations you may need .
The architecture of the building in itself is really breathtaking in terms of luxury and ornamentation choice .
Even if the architectural style may seem a bit ^_^ heavy , this building is really a masterpiece with no similar comparisons all over the world .
Although I have to admit that it is very tiring to visit the whole museum in one day , it is such a rewarding and enriching time that people get ^_^ tired of looking at the paintings and sculptures of each section of the museum .
The adjoining restaurant is very enjoyable as well .
To sum up , I would say that this museum is more interesting than the other museums , because you can enjoy not only wonderful masterpieces but also ^_^ very unusual architecture and a quiet restaurant to have a rest if you need to .
Thirdly , the end - of - conference party would be a small disco , with a variety of drinks and food provided .
Therefore , you could wear something quite casual .
Lastly , on the last day , I would suggest you ^_^ visit ^_^ Edinburgh Castle and the National Scottish Museum , as both of them are very interesting and have a student discount .
I hope this letter should help you with enough information .
Only people who could live without it , must be extremely weird or somebody in a very difficult situation !
We are nearly always surrounded by ^_^ ' man - made ' light .
Well , unless there was n't anything wrong with the power supply .
While I was in the toilet , all the lights were turned off !
I screamed and cried since I 'd never experienced being in ^_^ complete darkness before .
When the light was turned on again , I realised how important even a single light bulb would be , and I was sure I could never , ever live without it .
As the conference must go on , I will give you the information you asked for in order to work on with this conference .
According to the hotel , the group has been arranged to stay in a hotel which is very near the place we are going to have the conference .
It is just only a 5 minute walk from there to the conference and I would like to suggest that this is the best way to get to the conference .
About the party , we will have a party at the end of the conference at the hotel you will be staying at .
The party will be in a friendly atmosphere , so do n't worry about what to wear .
There will be only our group , so dress in whatever you want and enjoy ourselves .
The shopping centre is just right opposite to the hotel . However , some people may want to just wait at the hotel and have a cup of coffee .
How would you know what is happening in the whole wide world or even how you would get yourself breakfast without a toaster ! ! !
How would you cope with all this ?
Thank god for those who have created ^_^ electricity and have appliedapplied it into every appliance .
^_^ Electricity is a clever invention .
Everything is based on the use of electricity , for instance from a little bulb light to the most complicated computer system which stores priceless information !
^_^ Electricity is very important in keeping our lives going .
No matter where you are , what you do , apparantly , you need ^_^ electricity .
Let 's think this way , if we did n't have ^_^ electricity , there would be no other inventions at all ! !
I , personally , ca n't live without ^_^ electricity .
Moreover , other facilities in my house , the telephone , the air - conditioner , fridge , for example , ^_^ ^_^ all need ^_^ electricity . That is why it is very important to my life .
The end - of - conference party starts just one hour after the end of the conference .
So you do n't have to appear very noble dressed , just as you like it ( there is no order - you may wear what you want ) .
For your last day , I think it would be interesting to visit our historical and famous city - centre .
From there on , people got mobile phones and had the possibility to travel wherever they wanted .
Of course , within the physical barriers .
People now have the chance to move to far away places to spend their leisure time , to relax , or just to see something different than their home - countryside .
It has been quite hard for me not to have the opportunities for my free time like my friends that live in or near the city .
I just had no chance to meet them after school , because I had no vehicle to get there .
So with my car I achieved ^_^ great freedom .
I am applying to your letter where you asked for some information about the conference at Peterborough Regional College .
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , which is situated in the city center , ^_^ 15 minute walk from where the conference takes place ^_^ .
On the next page there is a map showing you the best way to get to the conference that will be at the Regional College .
For the people interested in it , there will also be ^_^ an amusement karaoke .
No jeans and tee - shirts .
There are a lot of places you can visit in Peterborough .
We have a Cathedral you can visit anytime and the river side , which is the best if it is a nice day , sunny and warm , to take a walk .
For any details , look on the next page ^_^ .
She had never passed a math exam and she was really nervous .
Half an hour before the exam , she went to the cafeteria to have a cup of tea .
Drank her cup of tea and she went to the classroom where the exam took place .
She did the exam really well . She was very surprised , and after the exam she went home .
She spent the rest of the day listening to music while she was thinking about the lottery ticket and waiting for the TV show at 8 o'clock .
At that time , she turned on the TV and while the lottery ^_^ man was shouting the winning numbers , she checked hers and what was ^_^ surprise that the last 4 numbers were the same ! !
She won £ 500 ! ! !
I ^_^ really appreciate your interest in our conference .
This is a very nice hotel and I am sure you will be very pleased with staying there .
However , we have already prepared a mini - bus for you .
Thirdly , we will have the end - of - conference party at 6 p.m. You can have dinner with wine , which is very famous in our area , and also you can enjoy the semi - classical concert which we have prepared for 3 months .
Lastly , you should not have any problem spending your extra time in Cambridge because we have a lot of attractions .
The Cambridge bus tour , for example , will be a very nice time for you because it is the best and the easiest way of getting to know Cambridge .
But if you do not like it , you can enjoy the city centre by walking tour and then you can enjoy going punting , which is the most pleasant attraction in Cambridge .
I hope you will be happy with our conference and party , etc .
We have prepared all of them for a long time .
Welcome to my town and I ^_^ really appreciate your visit .
This building consists of a world exposition centre , a multiplex cinema , a huge shopping mall , a huge food court and an aquarium .
Now there is an ' the world software for Linux ' exposition in the exposition centre .
If you are interested in computers , it will give you big pleasant .
If you want to buy something , especially clothes , the shopping mall , which is called ' COEX mall ' , will be the best place : very cheap and lots of designed clothes .
It ^_^ provides all kinds of food .
I am writing to give some information about the conference as you requested .
I would recommend you get to the conference by subway , because the subway station is situated a 5 minute ' walk from the hotel .
You will be able to buy them at a reasonable price .
In particular , ^_^ people seemed to be satisfied with the theatres , because the screen is massive .
The Korean restaurants appeared to be the most popular with foreigners .
It seemed you could buy everything you wanted at a reasonable price in the building .
In particular , Korean souvenir shops were felt to be extremely cheap .
I would highly recommend this building , because not only can you ^_^ enjoy yourself but also experience Korean culture which might be exotic to foreign visitors .
I am sure , together we can have a good student conference in my college .
I will give you ^_^ some useful information .
First of all , we come to some important points for the organisation .
The group has been booked into a comfortable and well - situated hotel , whose name is , " Palace Hotel " .
The hotel is on the right hand side of the Parker Piece , which you can find on the map , which I will send you .
The ^_^ " Palace Hotel " is a 5 minute walk from the station .
The conference is situated in the building opposite the bus stop .
After a short speech from our director , the evening entertainment will ^_^ begin .
In a well - known and enjoyable pub in the city centre we consume the same food and drinks .
Furthermore , there will be a very famous live band .
You do not have to wear ^_^ special clothes .
Naturally , we have a lot of interesting things to visit , but some things , especially ^_^ our cathedrale .
The architecture brings you back into the old times . as well as the stained glass windows which are really amazing .
We also have ^_^ an interesting museum and a modern theatre .
Finally , I am sure you and your group will have some fun relaxing days .
Please do not hesitate to contact me for some more information .
I look forward to meeting each other soon .
What is it what we use every day many hours ?
Sometimes , from early in the morning until late in the evening .
It is well known in almost all families , often with a lot of different cannels .
First of all , the TV can tell us news in a short time , what is happening all over the world .
Another point in favour of the invention of the TV is ^_^ that they tell about interesting reports , for instance about animals or different cultures from other countries .
Furthermore , they have a lot of different programs , usually something for everybody .
It could also be ^_^ relaxing to sit on the sofa after a busy day at work .
Finally , the TV is , in my opinion , very useful for getting important information . You can watch the weather and all of them are present in wonderful colour .
However , they send a lot of violence which is not good for the children .
I can not imagine ^_^ living without televison . It is something that we need for our education , for getting news and other helpful information .
Surely I 'll try to help you as much as I can .
To get from the hotel to the conference , you only have to take bus no.7 and get off at St. James College , where the conference will take place .
I suggest ^_^ wearing casual clothes . I think there 's no need for school uniforms .
To answer your last question , I would propose you ^_^ attend the local zoo , because many baby animals were born in the past few days .
Dear Mrs Smith , I hope the information given ^_^ is useful for you .
Could you imagine there 's no telephone ringing in an office ?
Or to live your life without chatting for hours with your best friend ?
I ca n't !
The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell at the end of the 19th century .
It was an invention . Nobody thought how important and how widespread it would be in the future .
Nowadays , almost every household in the western world owns a telephone , and calling to relatives or friends spread all over the world is no strange thing .
People need the telephone not only for chatting , but also for exchanging information in a very short and direct way with the possibility to answer immediately .
Dear Mrs ^_^ Smith ,
I want to inform you that I have already talked to Richard Brown and he informed me about the conference .
Next week I will ^_^ start organising some events for this conference .
The event will be organized at the Palace Hotel .
The same hotel that you will ^_^ staying .
The Palace Hotel is opposite the park ' Clifton ' , which is near the college .
We chose that hotel because it is ^_^ near the college and we do n't need to use ^_^ transport .
Because you know where ^_^ the college is and you need to bring with me some things from the college to the hotel , I think that it is better to come all the group in college and then we can go all together to the ' Palace Hotel ' .
The conference starts at 9:00 o'clock . You need to be at the college half an hour before .
Tell me your idea .
About the clothes that we need to wear , must be uniform , because it is the best conference in London and every year there are ^_^ lectures from other colleges .
Finally , on the last day , we have organised a sightseeing - crossing around London . You will have the opportunity to visit some museums and zoo parks .
Nowadays all ^_^ people have a telephone .
The telephone is part of our life .
It is one of the most important investigations ^_^ in the world .
The telephone is a type of communication .
If you want to talk with your friends , parents , partner or to ask something , you can call them without wondering how you can ^_^ communicate with them .
Especially if some of your relatives or friends are living in another country , you can communicate with them every and every day and you do n't feel that they are far ^_^ away from you .
Today , with the development of technology has been improved and the abilities of the telephone .
They are telephones where you have the opportunity to talk with more than one person on the line .
Also , you can leave a message if you call and ca n't find someone .
The last type of telephone ^_^ is the mobile phone .
You can use it everywhere and at anytime .
Finally , the telephone , exception from type of communication , is a type of socialisation .
Nowadays , we are so busy and we do n't have free time to see our friends . We can call them and talk or chat with them .
Especially ^_^ young people ^_^ spend many hours on the telephone and that is trouble for their parents .
The telephone is very important investigation if we can use it correctly without using it as a type of entertainment as they are doing nowadays many people .
As you know , a hotel whose name is Palace Hotel has been booked for your group .
As you know , it is not suitable to wear ^_^ jeans or something .
On your last day , you have an afternoon free .
Yours Sincerely ,
How much can a computer affect your life ? I think it affects more than you think .
I first bought a computer when I was in university .
It was so necessary for me because I wanted to be a computer programmer .
At that time , I met the magic world of computers .
Do you think you have the information you need whenever you want ?
Do you think you can contact ^_^ anyone who is from any country whenever you want ?
I meet a lot of people on the internet and it really interests me .
Everything in this world will work with computers from now on .
Computers changed my life style , my opinion about the world .
And they affect everyone 's life directly or indirectly .
First of all , the hotel is the Palace Hotel , 82 Regent Street , so that it is very easy to reach the conference .
In fact , you can take ^_^ bus number 3 ; as you can see , the bus stop is just in front of the hotel , then you can get off immediately after the church that you pass , on your right ^_^ .
Secondly , we will have the party in the hotel at 8.00 o'clock and a buffet will be served at 8.30 p.m. It would be ^_^ possible to get some vegetarian food and drink cocktails free of charge . I would recommend your students to bring their Identity Card to prove their age .
What is more , I would suggest ^_^ wearing very smart dress and for men ^_^ ^_^ oblidged the tie .
Finally , if I were you , I would go shopping in the City Centre to spend your last hours .
However , if you are interested in archeology you should visit the History Museum in Garden Square .
Have you ever thought about living without your car ?
In the last forty years , people seem to be completely addicted to using their own car .
It is said that the majority of the citizens have got a car and , unfortunately , this is the reason why cities are getting more polluted .
In fact , we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our family and carrying luggage and shopping bags .
Cars are able to cover not only short distances but also ^_^ be used for long journeys .
For example , in the past it would have been extremely exhausting to travel riding an hourse but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of options to choose from .
However , I have to say that it has made people ^_^ lazy and , at the same time , stressed due to the traffic .
That 's why I could n't imagine my life without it .
If a student is ill , we will return the money but you should tell us until one week before we start .
If you take public buses , it costs more ^_^ than a school bus .
One of our teachers , who will be voted by students is making a speeches for one hour .
Afterwards , a student ^_^ makes a speech about what he or she has learned . and dinner .
In my opinion , you should wear normal clothing .
I would like to suggest that you should visit building ^_^ sixty two , which ^_^ consists on ^_^ the second floor .
There are eye - max cinema , museums , garelty .
I look forward to hearing ^_^ from you soon .
Pusan Castle is located in the South of Pusan .
There are exhibited historical things , picthurs and clothes .
It was built four hundred ago .
and there is a very big park in the Castle .
Pusan Castle shows ^_^ Korea 's history from when one of our Kings made our country .
Restuarant .
Shop specially for groups .
What is more , every place is explained in English .
It cost ten pounds .
Fortunately , if somebody visits the castle over ten people , they give them a discount .
Dear Mrs ^_^ Smith
With reference to your letter which I received yesterday , I would like to give you some details about the international student conference , also the accommodation and activities that are planned during this week .
The hotel that is booked for the students ^_^ is one of the beast in the area . It has great facilities and it is situated near to the place where the conference is going to be .
The best way to get there from the hotel is by bus and it is already booked for the next day . You arrive ^_^ at 8:30 am .
I hope this letter answers all your questions . If you want to know more about it , just give me a call or send me a letter .
your sincerely
The aim of this report is to give some information about the new Acapulco resart buildings which were built 10 years ago and it is one of the first buildings that was built with the latest technology and made by an important Mexican arquitector .
In addition , the resort has an interesting history background in architecture and the best facilities and activities that you could have in Mexico . For example , it provides different kinds of tours around Mexico .
In ^_^ contrast , it is far away from the city and it has difficult transport facilities .
In spite of the disadvantages , I would strongly recommend ^_^ students and the public ^_^ visiting the new Acapulco resort buildings ^_^ and having a great experience knowing about building history and at the same time traveling around Mexico .
I am afraid to hear that Mr. Brown is ill . I hope it wo n't be grave .
The name of the hotel in which the group is going to stay in is the Palace Hotel . To get there you must go to the centre of town . all buses ^_^ go there . Once you are in the centre , the Palace Hotel is right in front of the tourism information office .
For the end - of - conference party we have booked one of the halls of the hotel and they will provide us with live music and cattering .
Because the hotel is such an elegant place , I would suggest ^_^ dressing up in night clothes .
Finally , to fill your free afternoon , I would hardly recommend ^_^ visiting the cathedral and having a walk around the old part of the city . If you like , it will be my pleasure to show you the souroundings .
Chairs are not only part of the forniture , they are also objects of decoration and you can even find some in museums as art symbols .
In fact , nobody has got this clue , but it must have been the most clever person on earth !
The world is packed with so many tipes of chairs , from the common woden ones to the most sophisticated and comfortable others finding a baste range of prices .
From my point of view , the chair is without a doubt the most useful gadget ever invented .
Some people use them for their work , others ^_^ wish to get one by the end of the day and for some other people , a ^_^ chair represents the possibility of mouvement .
Although it is worth ^_^ saying that not everybody can choose his ideal chair , there is a special one for each of us .
I am glad to help you with the organisation of the conference .
I phoned ^_^ the tourist information last week and I got some information about the accommodation for the students .
I think we should book at the Palace Hotel .
I think they should wear smart dress , because there will be lots of interesting people and important meetings .
In conclusion , for the last day , I thought it would be very interesting for the students to visit the town and appreciate its monuments and art .
On the other hand , if you prefer to have a relaxing day , you could have a pic - nic in the wonderful park .
I hope my suggestion and idea will help you to organise the meeting .
As requested , the aim of this report is to assess the suitbility of a group of American students for the visit to the Etruscan Museum .
The Etruscan Museum is one of the most attractive buildings in my town .
It contains lots of archeological Etruscans founded and some remains of Etruscan neoropolis .
Also , there are some free handphones ^_^ that explain the history of the museum .
After their visit to the Museum , they could enjoy the superb view of the sea and the Tuscan Archipelago , and they could have a pic - nic on the beach .
Although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students , I strongly recommend it for their excursion and their interests .
Dear Mrs ^_^ Smith ,
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , which is one of the most comfortable hotels in London .
It is based in the city centre and is about half an hour by underground from the conference .
In my opinion , the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taking the Picadelly line .
However , you should take bus number 150 , if you would like to have a look at the city centre and you have some free time also .
Regarding ^_^ the end - of - conference party , I would suggest ^_^ wearing some dress for a woman and an elegant suit for a man , though , it is not formal ^_^ .
The party will finish quite late , so we 've decided to provide a bus which would take you to the hotel safely .
Basicaly , for three hours ^_^ in the afternoon , nobody is able to visit all of the interesting places in London .
However , you should have a long walk along the river to take some essential photos .
Are you always happy when your telephone rings ?
As far as I am concerned , the telephone was invented in the 19th century .
It has ^_^ affecting our lives very quickly , although there are some different ways of communication as TV , for instance .
Since the internet was introduced , many of us would n't have imagined ^_^ life without this .
We were able even to have our own telephone kept in our pocket for ^_^ some time .
On the other hand , I wonder whether you have experienced some situations when you would n't have your mobile switched on .
This invention has affected my life completely .
Since I have been traveling around the world , I would ^_^ imagine being in tough with my family or friends without the internet or my mobile phone .
In spite of having the opportunity of keeping in contact with friends at ^_^ time we are far away from home , we should have ^_^ know how to use it without interrupting others .
I will be pleased to help you .
The following is some information about the International student conference .
The party will ^_^ take place at the Palace Hotel .
You can see the sign of the hotel .
This is an international student party , so I suggest you wear traditional clothes .
It looks nice and has good meaning .
You can notice every student that they could make some traditional food for the party .
After the meal , you can play some games and prepare some gifts for the winner .
At the end of the conference you can dance and sing together .
Here is my suggestion for this party .
If you still have some problems , you can call me .
Report building of LUTON University
I heard that a group of American students had just arrived in our town .
It is the main building of LUTON University in Park square .
There is an academic building .
It includes a library .
There is a very big library .
You can find any information from it that you want .
^_^ The rest of the time , you can go to IT suit use the Internet .
I recommend this building to visit .
They can also talk with British students to communicate study experience .
I am writing with reference to your letter concerning the organization of an international student conference at Wimbledon Art College .
Below I am clarifying some information you asked about .
The group has been booked into the " Maria Luisa " hotel which is situated in the center of Wimbledon , called Wimbledon Village .
Secondly , turning to the end - of - conference party , it is planned to be on Wimbledon Common - a nice piece of England nature .
So , it may be a good idea to take some very comfortable and informal clothes .
Thirdly , talking about your free afternoon before leaving the area , I would suggest you ^_^ visit the Wimbledon Museum of Tennis .
It is quite a good exposition ^_^ , giving interesting information about the history of Wimbledon Tennis Tournaments .
I look forward to meeting your group at our conference .
The purpose of this report is to give a brief description of the Academy of Art in St .- Petersburg .
From my point of view , this building is the best option to visit .
This building is situated on the magnificent embankment of the Niva River with an excellent view of the Hermitage Museum .
The building was built by a very famous Russian architect and is a marvelous example of Russian classic architecture of the XVIIIth century .
In the Academy of Art you can find the oldest art library with a wide range of books , the Museum of Russian Art with a huge collection of painting , sculpture and architectural projects from the early eighteenth to late twentieth centuries .
It is also a good chance to be introduced to the Russian system of art education .
The building of the Academy of Art in St .- Petersburg is worth visiting and is interesting in both historical as well as educational aspects .
Your group has been booked into The Palace Hotel , located on the High street , opposite ^_^ the Post Office .
The conference will be held in The Royal Hall , and the best way to get there from the hotel is by bus .
About what you can do in the area for the free time you have , I would suggest you ^_^ visit The Modern Art Museum , which has ^_^ a new exhibition .
Another suggestion could be to visit the zoo , or just walk through the Spring Gardens , which are beautiful at this time of the year .
Yes , I know , it is just hard to imagine our lives without this invention .
Think about the people living at the time it was invented .
It must have been such an exciting thing to be able to talk to someone living thousands of miles away ........ and now for us it is just as simple as dialing a number and talking to whoever we want to .
For example , I work for a bank , and we need to have weekly meetings with our Director who lives 800 kilometers away , and he does n't have to come here . We just have a phone conference where everybody can talk , and that is it !
A phone call in time for an ambulance can save the lives of many people having a heart attack .
I am one of the students and I am going to give you ^_^ information , all you need .
We have ^_^ booked the hotel for you and the name of the hotel is " Palace Hotel " quite near the shopping centre .
It is not far away , you just go along Park Road for about ten minutes .
Then you will arrive at the Palace Hotel on the right hand ^_^ ^_^ .
About the end - of - conference party .
We are going to have a dinner before the end and at the end we are going to take you to the hotel . You need to wear a night - dress or suit and a bow tie .
Finally , on the last day you have three hours before you catch the plane , so we recommend ^_^ you can go to the shopping centre and buy something for your special person or go to the museum because this museum is the biggest in the world . Now it is up to you .
I am the student leader . We are grateful that your group has just arrived , so I am going to give information about an interesting building to visit .
We recommend you to go to the BBC building .
First of all , the BBC building is the news building of England .
On the ground floor , they have ^_^ video cameras everywhere around the building and police officers walk around the building as well .
Up on the first floor , they have a huge radio room , for sending and receipting ^_^ information from all over the world because they have a small BBC building all over the world too ;
For example , THAILAND , the United State of America , INDONISIA and CANADA .
And the second floor is the news room where they get on ^_^ air to show on ^_^ TV That is not finish . I just give you some information , but they have more interesting things you do not know .
I recommend ^_^ this building because this building is the main of London and this building is the second most beautiful building in London , so that is why I recommend ^_^ this building .
I would be very pleased if I could help you by answering all your enquiries .
I would suggest you ^_^ walk along New Street , which is the one next to the river , and in 10 minutes you will see the hotel on your right ^_^ ^_^ .
The hotel is just opposite from the City Hospital .
As you already possibly know , the end - of - conference party will take place in the main reception room at the same hotel .
Answering your question , you should be fine wearing casual clothes .
The invention , without no doubt , that has affected my own life by far is the car .
Cars have definitely changed all our lives , and I am not refering only in a positive way , but in a negative way as well .
Can you imagine it ?
Traffic jams make people nervous , sometimes really upset and violent .
But , anyway , people use cars .
If we do n't use them we suffer from them .
I really need it to escape from the pollution , mainly caused by cars and any other four - wheel motored vehicle .
Is n't that contradictorious ?
To go to the countryside and be able to breathe fresh , non - polluted air , I use my car , which , as far as I am concerned , does not help to maintain ^_^ clean air at all .
Therefore , I am thinking about selling my car , which has changed my life over the last 10 years , which has given me a kind of freedom , which has gone with me to all sorts of fantastic places , and changed my life for a new life : without a car .
It was very bad news for Richard Brown .
I have given ^_^ information about the international student conference .
Number 45 bus runs ^_^ there every 5 minutes .
It takes 25 minutes that is convenient for us .
Secondly , there are some programmes that are really great .
First time , the conference 's head makes a short speech and then we have dinner and drinks .
Finally , we enjoy a disco party , so you wear a suitable dress .
Alice and Jane came back to her home .
In the morning they ^_^ met and then they went to the beach .
Jane suddenly thought about her house key that was left inside her house and Alice could see ^_^ her house and he found the bathroom window was opening .
So he climbed on the radder up to the window and he opened the door , but policemen came there . " What happened ? "
Jane explained that situation and they under stood him .
It was a very wonderful party and they have never forgotten that day .
Dear Mrs ^_^ Smith ,
I am writing to give you the information that you asked me for .
This hotel is very good placed .
From there you can get a taxi , catch the buses seven and eleven , which both have you very close to the conference place , and also you can go by underground to get there .
Then , after the conference , there will be a formal party at the group 's hotel , which starts at 9:00 PM and finishes at 12:00 AM .
This party is a formal one , so you should be casual dressed .
In this area you could visit the central park .
I hope this information will be useful for you .
Yours Sincerelly
Hampton Court palace is located in Hampton Court .
In addition to that , I think this town is wonderful and it has a magical beauty .
From there , depart the trains to Hampton Court .
They are between three and six pounds each .
And also , it would be an excellent chance for this group of American students to see it .
Thank you for your letter , which arrived on second .
I am very pleased to help to organize this conference in our college , which will be held at the Conference Centre at Bromley College starting on 20th June for 3 days .
Please find the information you requested as follows :
called " Palace Hotel " , which is about 10 miles away from our college . The hotel will have a coach to pick the group up from the airport on 19th of June and then take the group to the conference and return to the hotel every day .
Regarding ^_^ the end - of - conference party .
We have planned a barbecue at 5 oo pm . on our most idyllic play field which is over ^_^ the endless countryside and farms .
We can move to our student hall to have a disc dance until 10:00pm .
On the last day , we have arranged a small party in the hotel , then we all set up to have a sightseeing tour of Bromley town center for about two hours before you leave for the airport .
Bromley town center is the most beautiful shopping centre in South East London .
There are many historical buildings that remain .
We need lamp lights in offices or schools or some other places during the day time .
How ^_^ ^_^ wonderful life is after the invention of light .
Here we just talk about the light we invented apart from natural light .
There was no any light outside our house , no light on the road or fields either .
This scary dark is still affecting my life now .
I never stayed out after dark today except accompanied by my family .
What the great person on ^_^ earth ^_^ who invented ^_^ light , Einstein ^_^ .
He created another day ^_^ after sunset . People use it to do anything they want to do . We believe we ca n't live without light today , especially in city life . We have a long time to spend on ^_^ activities after the sun goes to bed .
Which we definitely need light to keep on . I dare to say , without light , our life will go into a dark , dark hell .
I am writing to you to reply to your question about the conference in London . Thank you for your letter .
I am very pleased to know you decided to come to the " II International conference of Human Rights " which will be held at Albert Hall college next 25 ^_^ June .
I would like to inform you that the group you belong to , has been booked in the Palace Hotel , in the center of London from the 24 June until the 25 of June .
The Albert Hall College , the building where will be taking part in the conference , is situated near Green Park Avenue ; so , to get there from the Palace Hotel you can take the bus number 26 , otherwise , you can take the Picadilly Line from South Kensigton Station to Green Park station .
Therefore , that 's the best mode of transport you can choose .
The Conference will start at 9 am on 25 June and will finish at about 6 pm on the same day .
During the day there is supposed to be a break of half an hour at 12 p.m and finally , a party for all the people who will be there .
That will be a smart party and , because of this , it will ^_^ require a well - dressed and immaculate presence .
Ladies should wear an evening dress and gentlman a dark suit .
As I can see from your letter , you will have about three hours before you catch your plane , so , I would suggest ^_^ visiting The Tate Modern Museum , where you will ^_^ find several interesting pictures such as Dali 's Warhols .
If you need some more information or details about the conference , you can contact Alexia on 0033 * * * phone .
The aim of this report is to give some suggestions to a group of American students who have just arrived in Rome and want some information about an interesting building to visit .
Rome is a big city where they can find several moments and important buildings . For this reason , I would suggest them to visit
1 ) " Fontana di Trevi " sited in Trevis Square in the center of Rome .
That 's a small square where there is a fountain ^_^ ^_^ .
It was built by Canovas architects in 1638 .
That is the fountain where the " Dolce Vita " film ^_^ took place .
2 ) On the other hand , there is Villa Borghese Building . That is a museum where they can find the most important sculptures and pictures of Antonio Canovas and ^_^ Bernini , who lived for a long time ^_^ in Rome .
I would recommend ^_^ the buildings because :
1 ) First of all , they are located in the center of Rome , so , they can take a bus to get them to and around the city .
2 ) Secondly , they can enjoy visiting museums , and afterwards they can take something to eat or to drink in the " pizzerias ' and restaurants near these famous places .
In conclusion , they could combine art , ^_^ history and the night visiting one only place without spending much money .
There is some information you have asked me about .
That is the best option because it is located less than a 5 minute walk from the Conference Center .
When you live in a hotel , you have to turn right and you bloun the street .
That 's our Conference Center .
At the hotel reception you will find printed information on how to get over there .
As you know , at the end - of - conference there is a party .
The party is due to start at 8 p.m until 3 a.m. There is a 2hr break between the end - of - conference and the party .
At this time , you and your group can refresh yourself .
Hope you will enjoy it .
We prepared some special attractions like live dance music and hot or cold buffet .
As ^_^ ^_^ the last question , I can suggest ^_^ visiting the Royal Castle .
Yours faithfully ,
In our town there are so many interesting places to see that it is hard to choose one .
It is situated on a hill , so it is very easy to recognize when it is it .
Actually , it is a whole complex , the Old and the New Castle , Cathedrall and the most interesting underwear part with its ^_^ amazing crypts .
And if you climb to the top of the main tower - the keep , you will see an unforgettable view of a white town .
You will find ^_^ an amazing collection of old weapons , armores and , we are especially proud of it , the great collection of swords .
After that , I am sure you will be happy to find a few restaurants located at the New Castle .
I am sure that should be enough for a one day trip .
For you information I can say that at this time we have a five - week festival and that tonight there will be a great display .
That should complete that amazing day .
I do welcome you and your group , and I am willing to help you by giving the information that you have asked me for .
Firstly , let me explain the way from the PALACE HOTEL , where your group will be staying , to the conference .
Finally , I would like you to recommend the visit to a traditional Korean palace , Kyong Bok , for the last day 's free time .
It must be a very interesting visit for the students who have never experienced an oriental atmosphere .
This report provides ^_^ information about Kyong Bok Palace , which is highly recommended to visit by visitors from foreign countries .
It highlights the background history and considers the interests of young people , and makes a final recommendation .
The kingdom of Chosun has a history of 500 years and lasted until the beginning of the 20th century .
As the kings of Chosun loved to be a part of ^_^ nature , the palace had a huge garden . However , it was destroyed by the army of Japan , and now there remains only a part of the original palace .
There is a special monument for the last queen of Chosun who was killed by the Japanese army .
The reason that this palace is also popular for ^_^ youngsters , who tend to dislike ^_^ historical visits , would be the various activities .
Also , there are performances which are held daily at the front gate of the palace .
I am writing in response to your letter where you asked me to give you more information about the international student conference and give some ideas and suggestions about what you and your students can do during your free time here .
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , which is located in the central area of the city , so it will not take you and your students too much time to get to the town hall where the conference is supposed to be held .
The easiest way to get there from your hotel is to take buses 461 or 176 ( the bus stop is opposite to the hotel ) or we can hire a minibus for you , but there is an extra charge for it .
Please note that the alchocholich drinks are only sold until 11 pm .
Coming back to ideas and suggestions , I promised to give you a free afternoon before you catch your plane . I can advise you to visit our zoo or to for a picnik in a park before you ^_^ go to the night party .
Such ^_^ simple and usual things like a telephone , a car , a computer ^_^ only seem to be normal and usual for us ( or we have got used to ) as we use them every day .
hundred years ago , people could n't even use an electric lump or talk about a car or computer .
They have ^_^ improved our lives a lot since they ^_^ appeared , but not every one believes it is really so .
Some people say that many of the important inventions in our lives are not so good and useful as we have got used to seeing them .
First of all , they say about environmental pollution which cars and other vehicles cause , overspending on electricity using electric equipment and some others .
But in my opinion , if ^_^ inventions take a place in our lives , they are right then .
I think the telephone is the most important thing in many people 's lives as it allows you ^_^ be able to get in touch with anyone , does n't matter wherever you are ( I am talking about mobile phones which now have a majority of our choice ) .
An electric lamp was an important invention a hundred years ago ( but for that time it was like a revolution ) .
I think it would n't be possible to survive ^_^ ^_^ without an electric life .
Because of shipbuilding development , people can make all ^_^ geographical discoveries , and ^_^ automobile transport is an undenyable necessity in our life .
In case ^_^ all said , I am more likely to think that the benefits of advantages of people 's inventions are much higher than all their disadvantages .
I have just read your letter and I am happy to help by giving you some further information .
According to your first question , for the time of the conference the students will be staying at the Palace Hotel , where the reservation has been already made .
As you were informed , there will be a party for all attendants of the conference , which will take place afterwards at the hotel restaurant .
Minding the fact that it will be an entirely sociable meeting , I believe that casual clothes are the most suitable option for this event .
Finally , answering your last question about students ' day - out , I suggest visiting the local lawn tennis museums and Wimbledon Tennis Courts as it is one of the best international tourist attractions .
If you have any further questions , please do not hesitate to contact me .
SUBJECT : Recomnendations of a place to visit
The aim of this report is to give a description and recommendation of the most interesting building in the town .
The place I would like to recommend is the seventienth - century Royal Palace .
It is situated in the heart of Warsaw and surrounded by the buildings of the Old Town .
There is a square old market with the magnificent statue of ^_^ King Zygmunt , in the centre of it .
Inside the Palace , there is a museum of an antique collection of porcalaine .
The Old Town is the best place for an afternoon stroll with a great number of restaurants , caffes and street performers .
There is ^_^ easy reach to cashpoints , lavatories , emergency services , etc .
There are a number of hotels or youth hostels to stay overnight , if necessary .
Most of ^_^ admissions is absolutely free .
A part of the Palace might be closed , due to the constant renovations .
All the facilities are usually overcrowded during the summer holiday .
Dear ^_^ Mrs ^_^ Smith
I am replying to your letter for the help you ^_^ ^_^ need .
I am pleased to tell you the information ^_^ you need for the group .
The hotel I ^_^ ^_^ booked is Palace Hotel , which is in the center of London just two blokes from Victoria station .
I think it is very convenient for the group . You know the Victoria area is easy to travel from there to the rest of the city . ^_^ The hotel is cling , and has a good room . The rooms are dobuels and we have a bathroom and for the nomber of students we get a good Valud . and the best way to get to the College for the Conference is to walk to the Victoria station . Get the tram to Glouster Road and 3 blokes to the right hand you will find the College .
However , I am going to make a plan for the students with all of the details and adres .
About the party at the end of the conference we organise in the same hotel which has a nice salon .
It will be good for your group . You do n't need to move to ^_^ another place .
We 'll have drink and food and music for dance .
It is not a formal party , so I think it is fashionable to wear something not too formal .
I want to make suggestions for the last day . You and your group should ^_^ go to Green Park and visit the Queen House and the Parlamente This area is very nice and the group would enjoy it ^_^ the conference get French ear and another exhibition could be the new ^_^ galery I have never been there but it could be a good experience to visit it with you .
I hope you found this letter uselfuel and if you have any questions let me know .
I am looking forward to seeing you soon .
Yoors sincerely
The computer was invented 30 years or years ago and the estart lake of procesing information with a big cad was perfored and made a smile hold and another hold means something like a Codig .
The machine that was used for reading this cad was too big . You usually ^_^ need a room for your computer .
I remember when I had a fare lesson at ^_^ University and the teacher took me to the Computer Center and I saw these machines all my college and my ^_^ learning was very difficult . Imagent how you can work on these kinds of computers .
^_^ These days , the computer is part of your own life . You use it all the time . Some times you do persona or anoder is just ^_^ something you need to do , like going to the bank , using the transpor , going ^_^ shopping etc . is a means that makes ^_^ life easy and ^_^ you can use it ^_^ It is amazing the way as ^_^ ^_^ the computer changes the programas are ^_^ quicks and for useful and practical
But the computer has a bad sead too I ^_^ mean we will live one day dependent ^_^ and ^_^ on it .
So I feel ascere when I think about the circumstances if some of the viruses or mad people make bad use of lake ^_^ these days with ^_^ sex or something .
I work with children and the computer helps my job ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ .
So I hope the Wold meke Consense ^_^ and the Inguener in Compueter work have ^_^ estop these problems because some good could be some ^_^ very dangerous .
I am writing to give you some advice about an international student conference .
And we have two choices to get to the conference , a bus or a train .
Both of them are as convenient as getting there .
The day before we ^_^ leave there , we have a party which will take place in our hotel .
I suggest that you wear a formal dress .
There is some finger foods and drinks .
It 's quite ^_^ nice and a suitable place to spend ^_^ three hours .
If the telephone had been invented , we would n't have lived perfectly like nowadays .
Would n't you think we rely on it more than we expect ?
A telephone is used when we need to contact ^_^ someone , and also in emergency situations and the internet .
There are various ways to use it . However , nowadays it is not only used for these purposes , but also ^_^ keeps us company .
Even if you feel alone , you can talk and hear from your friend easily .
A long time ago , people lived without this perfect invention .
They used to keep in touch with someone with a letter .
So that 's why they ^_^ invented the telephone .
Now we can feel the world closer and closer to ^_^ a telephone .
Who would n't be thanked for this great invention ?
The easiest way from the hotel to the conference is by ^_^ bus .
Take the bus in the direction of center town .
If you leave the bus , the conference is in the house opposite the road .
Afterwards , we will eat together in a restaurant and we will go to a disco .
For the disco , you must wear blue jeans .
Finally , on your last day , I propose you ^_^ do a sightseeing tour in our town .
Afterwards , you will have ^_^ time to buy some souvenirs from Switzerland .
If you have any more questions , write me back .
Yours faithfully ,
Before the time of computers , people had to write every ^_^ a whole letter .
When they ^_^ correct a word , they have to write the whole letter again .
With the computer we can write a letter , correct a word or change the name without writing the whole letter again . We save the letter and in three weeks we can send it to another person .
I work at a bank and I work all day on computers .
If we hand't get one , we had to write all the transactions on paper .
If I order money from our bank with the computer , I can be sure that it will arrive the day after .
But if I had to write a letter and ^_^ send it by post , the money would arrive two or three days later .
I have never worked without a computer , but if we had n't had any we would ^_^ find it normal .
I 'm pleased to be able to help you with the international student conference .
The hotel into which the group has been booked to is the Palace hotel , which is situated near the big bridge of Mont Blanc .
To get from the hotel to the conference , you have to take the highway indirection of Lausanne , and after nearly half an hour of driving you come out at the place which is indicated with Coppet , Divonne .
When you come out , just go on your right , and then turn left to follow the indications to the Châtaigneroie school .
You should wear some formal clothes , but not necessary really pretty clothes
I hope that this information will help you
The portable phone is a very useful invention !
During all mankind 's history , there were discovers who tried to make human life better , but it is in the last century that there were the ^_^ biggest discoveries made .
But the research went on , and the portable phone is getting ^_^ smaller and more useful .
The portable phone is an important invention , because nearly everybody has one , and so one can always call somebody if there is a problem .
Moreover , some portable phones have a connection to the web , so it is easy to read newspapers if one hasn't enough money to buy them .
Personally , the mobile phone has affected my own life , because when somebody is phoning at home , I do n't have to rush to take the phone , being afraid that it 's too late .
I recommend this extremely important invention to those who still do n't have a portable phone .
I would be pleased to help you with all your questions and I will provide you with some information which you need as much as I can .
I would like to inform you that Centeral Red Lion Hotel has been booked for the accommodation of the group and it will be quite easy to get every where from the hotel on foot during your stay .
As you know , we arrange an evening party on the third day of the week . We can say that is a kind of relaxation time .
Nothing will be special .
The place is college garden .
The time is 7 pm .
Everybody can put on something casual .
Before learning about England , I suggest you ^_^ visit the cannals and small villages around Basingstoke . You could find the opportunities to see the country life .
I have to admit that whoever invented ^_^ cars and transportation vehicles made the most respectable invention of the world .
I say that it must be the most important thing for us because they save us time passing so fast .
It is 10 times as quick as getting somewhere on foot .
Would n't be unbarable and painful .
Ceartainly it would be just like mine .
Because I live in a rural area far from any village , town , or city center .
The nearest civilization takes me 1 hour on foot .
Even coming to Basingstoke seems like an international journey to me .
And of course , this stops me every ^_^ living a sociable life .
But also I 'm aware of that ^_^ time flies for me . I must do whatever I want before it is too late .
And I have to confess the invention of the car was the most useful invention for ^_^ humanity .
I was delighted to receive your letter and to know that a group of students from your college have decided to take ^_^ part in our international student conference .
As you need more information , I will answer all your questions with pleasure .
It is one of the most comfortable hotels in our city and is situated only half a mile from the main building of our college , so it is very simple to get from there to the conference by foot .
Secondly , our end - of - conference party ^_^ includes dinner and dancing . I would advise you to wear something not very formal .
Finally , you can spend an afternoon on the last day visiting local historical places ( castles , built in the 13-th century ) or art gallery , as well as the beautiful Bodnant garden .
I am looking forward to the meeting with you and mutual work during the conference .
Your sincerely
We are so used to them , that sometimes think they always exist ^_^ .
Some of them are very practical , others are rather strange .
I think ^_^ that one of the most important and affecting ^_^ life inventions is the telephone .
In another situation , your son is ill , he needs help urgently .
I am sure ^_^ the phone has saved many lives .
Besides , it is always very nice to ring your friend or mum , just to chat at any time .
Thanks to the phone , it is possible even your mom is on the other end of the Earth .
To be honest , the next great invention of people , the computer , ca n't work , if you haven't got the phone .
So I am very grateful to the man ^_^ who invented it . Unfortunately , I have forgotten his name .
Try to ask who invented the will or the book .
It is with great regret that I hear of Mr Brown 's illness , and hope to see him soon in ^_^ excellent health .
Furthermore , since it is located between the airport and our location , a bus shuttle has been organised to pick all our guests from the hotel to the conference room .
The end - of - conference party is to be held in the ' Royal Room ' of the hotel , which has an outstanding reputation for its quality and seriousness .
Therefore , all guests will be asked to wear the corresponding clothes in order to be accepted .
As for the three hours of free time , I strongly suggest you ^_^ check - in your luggage at the airport and then , after a five - minute bus ride , spend your time in the marvellous ' Old City ' .
The technological revolution taking place today can be directly linked to the amazing evolution of our communication abilities throughout those last years .
The inevitable invention symbolizing this aspect in our ordinary life is , of course , the mobile phone .
It is clear and irrefutable that the use of this invention has become a necessary condition in some professional activities .
However , the common man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone becomes , when in the hands of a high - school student .
It has become ^_^ a real obsession for the average students , as they use it before ^_^ lessons , during ^_^ lessons , during lunch and , especially , during examinations ...
Nevertheless , it is also a common mistake to believe that the sole purpose of such an usage is to communicate information during an exam , since its major role is actually to allow the student and the parents to discuss during everyday ^_^ courses .
The bottom line is that any teacher complaining about this situation should confiscate ^_^ the student 's phone , but not his parents ' !
I have just received the letter from you and I 'm writing to you as soon as possible .
I can promise ^_^ you that I 'll do my best to help you .
As I 've just checked , the group has been booked into The Palace Hotel .
The best way to get from there to the conference is by coach , that I have arranged for you .
He will pick you up at 11 oo a.m. The conference is from 12 oo to 2 oo p.m. At the end of the conference there is a party from 2 o clock to 3 o clock .
I suggest you ^_^ wear comfortable and nice clothes because I have planned a sightseeing tour for you before your plane at 8 oo p.m. I 'd like to show you a museum , a gallery and the gardens that ^_^ belong to the palace .
Then we can have a rest in the cafe and talk before your flight home .
I think I have given you all the important information .
Nowadays , motorization is one of the most important inventions .
As you look around , everybody has a car or motorcycle .
No matter that people started worrying more about pollution in the world .
I love motocycles and I do n't think I could live without them .
I have been driving a motorcycle since I was 16 years old .
Me and my brother ^_^ used to go to ^_^ rock concerts .
We have met a lot of people there same mad about motorcycles as we were .
We were avenging races and trips .
We were driving motocycles few days before we finally ^_^ got to mitting points .
I really enjoy driving a motorcycle .
When I drive it is only me and my motorcycle .
Before me and after are my friends that I like and trust .
And around me nature that I can watch and enjoy while we shop for camp .
We can go to any place we like , avoid traffic and ^_^ full buses , trains , etc .
I am really grateful to the people who invented the first motorcycle in the world .
I feel very bad about that I do n't know who it was ^_^ .
It is reasonably near to the college , so it may be very good to walk from the hotel along the River Thames following yellow signs on sunny days .
If it rains , you can take bus 54 that stops in front of the college .
The end - of - conference party is designed to give rough ideas about many different cultures .
As a part of this , the leader of each group has to wear a costume of her country .
Other members of groups can wear ^_^ normal pretty formal dress .
On the last day , I recommend that you ^_^ visit the place that is located at the centre of our city .
Well , I am sure that you can hardly do this unless you are living deep in a forest or in a dessert !
It improves the productivity of my homework , which is often essay writing , and also ^_^ allows me to access ^_^ the internet .
To sum up , I can say that the greatest ever invention is the invention of computers that has affected both individuals and ^_^ society as a whole .
The conference is commensing on 31st June 2001 from 10.00 - 15.00 .
A light lunch will be provided .
There is no dress - code for the party .
However , I suggest you could wear the same outfit as you wear for the conference .
I have included the local map . There are some ideas on the back of the map .
Please let me know if you would like to book one of the city - walk tours . We have arranged special discounts for the conference attendance .
Personally , I recommend the Dicken 's tour because it is a good length of walk and very historical .
I hope that I have covered all the information you would need and look forward to seeing you .
Yours faithfully ,
P.S. Please find the enclosed map .
Despite the fact that this building ^_^ serves half - a million commuters ^_^ a day , it is always clean and functional .
The newly decorated section is fairly modern style with escalators and touched - screen ticket machine .
It is also very well linked to the old underground station , which ^_^ is such a contrast in transformation .
You can really imagine what it looked like in the old days .
At the far back of the station is also connected to a spacious , well - designed pedestrian park .
It is a good example of a great architecture that was designed to provide services to the public .
Finally , it is in the heart of the city and everyone will be able to find it without doubt .
So the conference will be a great experience for you and your group .
A free shuttel - bus gets you to the conference - center .
The bus leaves at 8 a.m. at the front entrance of the hotel .
The end - of - conference party is playing in a rent and in the greenground .
There will be a barbecue , a place to dance and many more .
It was a surprise !
I suggest ^_^ wearing leisure - clothes to the party .
On the last afternoon , you could go on a city - tour , visit the museum of Fine Arts or enjoy the beautiful flower garden next to the public park .
I hope I can give you some ideas . I look forward to seeing you .
How was it in the 19th century with no opportunity to communicate by phone and how would it be now ?
We are living in a busy world .
In the business world , you use the phone all the time to speak with your clients , to make appointments , to order an article etc . ; Then , time is money !
So , what did the phone - revolution do for us ?
Actually , the college is situated 500 meters away from the hotel .
There are so many places of interest in Lausanne , but I think that the Olympic Museum is the most notable for the following reasons :
You can see the evolution of sports and understand why changes gradually ^_^ been done to improve them .
You can admire every kind of equipment you need to do any particular sport .
You will be informed about the story of sport in general and about the new technologies which are used nowadays in high competitions .
The museum is near the city center and is accessible by bus or walking .
It will take you an afternoon to visit it and then you can enjoy a drink or a meal in the restaurant on the third floor , well - known for being one of the best establishments in Lausanne .
First of all , your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel , Main - Road 21 , which is situated not far from our college .
I 'd suggest you ^_^ walk . It will only take you about seven minutes .
Just follow Main - Road until you reach a junction , where you turn right and then walk along Denl - a - Lion Road .
Secondly , you have requested information about the end - of - conference party .
There is no need to put on special clothes for the party , casual ones should do it as well , for we want everyone to feel comfortable .
Last but not least , I will give you some ideas of where to spend your free afternoon .
I 'd suggest you ^_^ visit our local museum , as there is a marvellous exhibition there at the moment .
Provided the weather is fine , you could also go swimming or take a tour through our beautiful town .
Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop in for a moment ?
When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone , he had no idea of how popular it would be one day .
Its first appliance was in order to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person .
Nowadays , however , the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one could imagine life without it .
Please give him my best wishes for his recovery .
It is a very cosy building that is on the same avenue as the conference building , approximately one mile away .
There is a direct bus link between the two locations : this is bus line number six ; the bus station for the conference building is called " Avenue de cour " and the one at the Palace Hotel is named " Main station " .
Concerning the party , we do not have a casual dressing code .
Students usually wear dark clothes with a tie for the boys and a medium - long skirt or dress for the girls .
I think that the car is one of the human inventions that has the most affected the way of life of people from industrial countries .
The industrial countries have encountered deep evolution of their strictures since the car was ^_^ made available to everyone .
The transport network has changed according to this social evolution .
A lot of roads and motorways are overcrowded , and environmental issues are more and more related to the intensive use of cars and lorries .
People and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the environment without impacting their mobility .
All the students and staff will join together in the hall .
They can play games and talk about personal experiences .
The main aim of it is to deepen the friendship among all these pupils coming from all over the world .
So it would be fine if you wore casual clothes and looked smart .
I have made an arrangement for the afternoon on the last day for you .
If you are free , I will show you around our college .
You asked me about an interesting building to visit .
The museum looks very old as some other buildings in London , but it is very modern inside .
After going through the enormous main door , you can see a huge white round building which is a library .
A lot of famous people have been to this library before !
Almost each one tells you a story or gives you a picture of British history .
Apart from the national history , there are more content about the past of the world .
You can go to many sections such as Asia Hall , Egypt Hall , Europe Hall and so on .
Countless fascinating things will definitely take you the whole day to appreciate .
After a visit to the British Museum , you will definitely be ^_^ able to put your history textbook away !
It is simple to find the way from this hotel to the conference .
You are asked to take the blue door .
After entering you will see the signed conference room .
We organized an end - of - conference party on the day before your departure .
You should wear nice and comfortable clothes .
I suggest you visit the old part of Zurich or go to the zoo before your departure .
If there are any questions left , please contact me .
I love baking cakes , cookies and bread .
It does n't matter in what kind of mood I am , I can do it all the time and it makes me feel good .
If there is someone who does n't agree with me , he or she should try to live one month without using the oven .
Besides that , he or she should look carefully into what he or she buys .
I 'm positive that after such an experience , everyone will say that the oven is a really important invention for our lives .
I 'm thanking the person who invented the oven .
And I understand that you need help , so ^_^ I will help you as far as I can .
Firstly , the hotel which has been booked for you is the Palace Hotel that is located close to the conference .
In order to get from the hotel to the conference , you just need to take the bus we will offer .
Finally , if you want to have an exciting experience ^_^ here , I strongly suggest that you go to the musicals .
As you may hear , our city is well known for ^_^ musicals .
Or , if you want to relax , you can take a walk in the park situated ^_^ ten minutes ^_^ on foot from the hotel .
If you have more questions about the conference and something else , do not hesitate to ask me . I would be glad to be able to help you .
Some inventions are not regarded as great things even though ^_^ life without them can not be imagined .
However , there is something which is still believed that it was an extremely important invention .
From my point of view , the reason why electricity is such an important invention is that most of the machines , appliances and equipment which are used in modern times can be operated with only electricity , which makes people not to do too much physical labour .
At night , I can study because of it . and also it saves me time which would be used up for doing housework such as laundry , cleaning rooms and ironing .
It makes my life more convenient than ^_^ without it .
Dear Mrs. ^_^ Smith ,
I am very glad to help you with the International Student Conference .
I hope that our friend Richard Brown does n't have any serious willness .
This will be in the Casino Hotel and we do n't need to worry about the best way because ^_^ all the main routes in Devonport have signs with the correct way to the popular hotel .
After ^_^ the conference , there is a party in the same hotel .
At this party there is ^_^ some food , soft drinks , music and a special place for dancing .
This party is for the students , so the kinds of clothes wo n't be so formal .
On the day free before we catch our plane .
We could choose two options for spending our free time .
One is a guided tour of the center city , and another is visiting the chocolate factory .
Please , if you have any more questions , please call me on 38755980 .
In our lives , may be , could n't be without electricity .
When we ^_^ use different equipment in our houses , we ^_^ use ^_^ electricity .
Small things but very important in our lives .
I do n't like thinking , my house of my life , without all these facilities .
In winter when it is dark very early , and afterwards , I need to spend my free time at home .
What can I ^_^ do without my music and my computer ?
Now , ^_^ you just need to think about what you would do or what would happen in a city , with a car , aeroplans , shops , all these things without lights .
Finally , I think that everybody knows that ^_^ electricity is a very important invention and for me it is the best .
Thanks for your last letter and I am sorry for not giving you enough information .
We have already booked a 4 - star hotel - Palace Hotel , which is near the River Thames , in Walton - on - Thames .
The end - of - conference party will be held in an Indian restaurant ^_^ that is next to the hotel .
It is supposed to be held from 7 pm to 11 pm .
You can wear anything you like . We would like you to be just yourself and have fun .
There are so many things to do . Unfortunately , there is just 3 hours .
I hope I have given you enough information and if you still have some doubts , please do not hesitate to contact us .
Nowadays , our lives are becoming better and better .
Lots of great inventions have been invented in order to make people live comfortably .
" Television is just an amazing invention . " My good friend said ^_^ . I agree with her .
Firstly , television makes us know more about the world without travelling it all .
If there is no television , we wo n't know what ^_^ ^_^ other countries are like , or even what language they speak , unless we go to that country .
Secondly , for some reasons , it can educate young children .
Many TV programmes are especially made for children , such as " Learn follow me " and " Be good to others " .
Actually , they are quite good programmes and helped me know what I should do generally or how to behave nicely when I was still a child .
^_^ Last but not least , it is a good kind of entertainment .
Maybe you will think that playing basketball , going to cinemas and discos are much better than staying at home sitting in front of an object .
If sometimes I do n't want to go out and I do n't want to be lonely , that 's easy , just turn on the television and enjoy myself .
Personally , I do think television is the most important invention .
But if you have enough time , I would like to recommend ^_^ walk .
Because there are a lot of beautiful trees and you can see the sea .
By the way , the end - of - conference party is a kind of farewell party .
The first part , the chairman and a few guests will give a speech and the second part , the participants will evaluate themselves , and ^_^ the last part ^_^ will provide dinner and drinks .
It will not be a very formal party .
Everybody ^_^ enjoys themselves .
I hope it will be a good tip for you and if you have any problems , you can contact ^_^ me any time .
And have a nice time in my town and send my regards to Richard .
For example : electricity , computers , telephone , boats , and car ( wheels ) , etc .
Electricity could be able to invent other things .
It has absolutely reduced women 's ^_^ housework working time .
Furthermore , we can enjoy our night with lights .
Here are the answers to your questions .
You will stay in the Palace Hotel , which is situated in front of the railway station , Camberley .
To get to the conference , you catch the coach No.7 from the station and get off at the Camberley College bus stop .
The end - of - conference party will be held at the cafeteria in the college , which is next to the stadium .
It starts at 18 p.m. and ends at 22 pm .
We will prepare traditional English meals and some students from foreign countries will prepare their ethnic foods .
There is a museum next to ^_^ Camberley Station , which has a good collection of paintings and potteries , and it would be a good place for you to spend your free time .
Instead , there are a lot of shops around there , you can buy souvenirs .
The inside of the castle is always dark even in daytime .
She appears occasionally and opens every window in the castle .
People said she was seeking something and still seeking it even if she had been dead for 500 years .
The ghost story may not be true , but it has good furniture from the 16th century , and the castle itself is very beautiful .
I think it is worth while ^_^ watching .
I hope you 'll enjoy visiting there .
I ^_^ received your letter this morning .
I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill and is unable to attempt the conference ; I am glad that you are able to be the leader of the group .
I hope that the information below is very useful to you ^_^ during your attempt ^_^ conference .
I have booked a hotel not far away from our school .
You will then have an hour to check in and unpack all your luggage .
The conference will start on time at 12:30 , so I would suggest you ^_^ leave the hotel by 12:00 .
The best way to get to the conference is to follow along the college road and turn left toward the end . You then keep going straight , you will eventually see the main entrance of the college .
They all know where the conference is and when .
I would suggest that ^_^ wearing formal clothing , such as a tie , trousers and blaser .
They can play tennis , do athletics , swimming ... and many other sports events in our school , if they want to .
Or they can also visit ^_^ Epsom Town .
There are shops which sell clothes , food , and books ... They can decide what they want to do , it 's entirely up to them .
I am looking forward to seeing you and hope you have a safe flight over to England .
Yours faithfully ,
The building is called Chiang Kei - shek Momerial Hall .
The momerial Hall is surrounded by large playgrounds .
As you go into the main hall , you will see a huge statue of Chiang Kei - shek . This is because the building is the rememberence of how well Chiang did in history .
Next ^_^ the statue is protected by ^_^ guards . The guards will change every four hours .
Apart from the main Hall , there are also lots of other gallaries .
In these gallaries there are historical paintings and antique furniture which Chiang used .
These treasures are very old , even older than the history of America .
They are all being well looked after .
As well as all the treasures , statues and historical paintings ...
There are also restaurants ^_^ and modern gallaries .
Finally , if you go to visit this building , I will recommend you to stay at a hotel not far from the momerial Hall called the Hyatt Hotel .
It only takes about five minutes if you walk .
I have received your letter dated on the 12th June 2001 .
I am very happy to help you and I hope that the information ^_^ that I am going to give you , will be enough .
The Hotel is a big building in the middle of the town near the place " St - François " .
After the conference , we are going to stay in the Palace Hotel , but instead of staying in the conference room , we are going to move to the reception room where a dinner will be prepared for us .
Afterwards , a live band is going to play the rest of the night .
For the clothes , you have to wear something smart and classic .
If you want to stay in Lausanne during your afternoon free , the best thing to do is to go to Ouchy .
There , you can enjoy the landscape and have a bath .
Yours faithfully ,
OLYMPIQUE MUSEUM
The aim of this report is to give further information on an interesting building to visit in Lausanne .
The Olympique Museum is situated near the lake and offers , for the tourist , an unbelievable view of the mountains and the lake .
But also , the museum has a lot of gardens with several statues .
Besides , the architecture of the building is beautiful and very modern .
First of all , the main interest of the museum is the olympic history .
You can find a lot of documentarys about it and you have several competitors personal objects .
In addition , you can play ^_^ several interactive games and learn about the rules of the olympic games .
REASONS OF RECOMMENDATION .
The principal reason is the cheapest price .
On the other hand , if you are more than 10 people , you can have a group price and pay only 6 Frs per person .
It seems that this solution might be the best way to visit this museum .
Therefore , if you want to learn something about the Olympic Games , it must be the best place for this .
I 'm so happy to help you with this international student conference .
I 'm afraid of Richard .
Could you please tell him my best wishes for health ?
I 'm sure you can perfectly replace it to lead your group .
^_^ First , you should know that you are booked into the Palace Hotel , which is one of the best in the town .
First of all , you must walk down ^_^ ^_^ Central Street until you arrive at the bus stop , then you take ^_^ bus number two that goes directly to the college .
It starts at twenty o'clock until the end of the night , so be ready !
There is no special theme for the wearing style but it would be more fun if you wore something crazy ...
Finally , I propose you ^_^ go to the new college swimming on the last ^_^ afternoon .
I will give you some information on ^_^ Yverdon ^_^ castle .
This building is one of the oldest that stays in the landscape of the town .
I think it is important to see it when you come there because it shows us how the town has been developed around it since its creation .
These days , the castle is being remade , so there is a lot of construction engines around it .
That 's not a big problem because there is a complete museum in it where you can see old pictures of the castle during the centuries .
There are a lot of old items that were in the King 's family .
You should have probably heard about the mummy who slept there for about two thousand years ... You can see it in the dungeon .
I hope you will enjoy the visit and I wish you a nice holiday in Yverdon .
First of all , we have already booked the Five - Stars Hotel for your group .
It is a modern hotel , near our college , and it is also very convenient to get from the airport . You can take both by bus or taxi .
The nember 101 bus starts from the airport , then you can get off from the " city college " stop .
It would be a great chance to take part in a party for everyone .
This is just a relaxing party , just for the members to have a chance to relax and make friends .
So I think you 'd better ^_^ wear a dress .
Finally , about the free three hours , I I prefer to go shopping .
Our city has got the biggest shopping centre in South England . There are so many shops .
It worthes to spend time and money on that .
Nowadays , people have become used to watching television ^_^ programs every day .
The TV is so important that you can see it in every family , and it is an essential equipment for everyone .
First of all , in my opinion , TV has ^_^ great educational functions , and also makes the world become smaller .
You can just sit at home then you can know what is happening all over the world at the moment .
I would rather watch the news on TV ^_^ instead of reading in the newspaper or hearing on the radio because the news on TV is vivid .
Moreover , the TV is a great company for ^_^ people who live alone or feel alone . I would like to open TV when I stay at home .
Some are talking , laughing , crying in there , so join them , you will feel much better than just yourself .
Some TV programs are enjoyable !
You might just sit in front of the TV for hours learning nothing , or no more talk with your family .
I think this is the worst influence on ^_^ society .
In conclusion , the TV has both advantages and disadvantages , but on the whole , advantages are greater than disadvantages .
So , but on the whole , TV is still ^_^ a wonderful and important invention in the world .
I am writing to you to give you more information about an international student conference .
The group has been booked into the King Hotel in High Street , which is very easy to find .
And the best way to get from there to the conference is following the route in front of the hotel to the right , then crossing the zebra crossing to the opposite side .
After that , walk to the right about 15 metres and you will find the conference place which is called White House .
As this is a special conference , you could wear your own national dress to present your country .
Finally , on the last day you could spend your free time ^_^ visiting our town hall where you will be able to learn more about my area - or do some shopping in the High Street .
I am writing to give ^_^ information about a very interesting building to visit .
It is called Penrhyh Castle , as the building will tell you all about Wales .
On the positive side , you and the group will be able to learn more about Welsh art works which are presented on the wall , on the door and some furniture .
And some old toilets might look awful .
But in my recommendation , I think it would be nice for the students to come and see this building .
Because they will be able to learn and compare ^_^ the places in their country .
As Wales is not modern like America , ^_^ the students will probably get the idea of looking back to the old things .
I was really pleased to receive ^_^ your letter .
So , I 'm writing to reply to give all the information you asked for .
The best way to get from the hotel to the conference is using the tube because it takes only 20 minutes .
The tube has 2 lines which are red ^_^ .
And your speech would be better for the end of the conference party .
I 'd suggest you ^_^ wear at least ^_^ semi formal clothes such as a jacket with other clothes .
The computer is the most important invention in our life .
Some people might say ^_^ electricity is more important than other things .
However , I 'd say the computer is a more amazing invention ^_^ than other inventions such as the telephone , the car .
Recently , computers are really necessary and we ca n't manage to work without them .
Not only ^_^ for business , but also ^_^ for my life .
For instance , when I want to contact with ^_^ my friend , it 's quite helpful to use e - mail .
Before ^_^ computers ^_^ were invented , we could n't possibly have lots of information easily and we could n't contact ^_^ ^_^ foreign countries at the same time .
And also , it 's time to make a new system which makes us use easier and more ^_^ , so far more people can enjoy computers more than before .
Despite amazing inventions , some times computers cause big problems , such as the millennium bug ( some people call it the " 2000 problem " ) , because the computers are not flexible enough like a human 's brain .
However , computers are worth ^_^ using in our lives until more coveniance machines ^_^ are invented .
I would suggest everybody ^_^ wear ^_^ casual dress .
Finally , I would recommend you and your group to enjoy shopping and sightseeing around Oxford Street and nearby .
I look forward to seeing you and your group soon .
Yours Sincerely ,
As you requested , which is the most interesting building to visit ? I would strongly recommend the Barbican Centre building in the city .
There are also world stock market exchange , an opera theatre , shopping arcades , books and record stores .
It also holds an international exhibition all year round .
Recently , the exhibition of Africa just finished .
The opening time starts from 7.30 AM . till late at night when the theatre is closed .
The building is huge with high technology and construction and ^_^ tight security .
You and your group will visit one building which has so many places in this building .
So that you can spend your time in one go .
Dear Mrs ^_^ Smith
Thank you for your letter which arrived me this morning .
Of course , it is a pity that Mr. Brown has been ill , but we are happy that you are coming now .
The best way to get there ^_^ is to take the bus number 7 ^_^ .
You will leave the bus at ^_^ " Royal gardens " .
Turn left and go straight to ^_^ " Baker street " At the entrance of this street there is ^_^ house number 18 .
As far as I can see , there will be only a little dinner and a group of young singers will surprise us with their songs .
Moreover , you asked what to wear . Do not bother .
I would recommend you wear some casual clothes , like ^_^ jeans , a blouse or a skirt and a jacket .
Do forget to wear a pair of comfortable shoes , because you will not have a chance to change them .
Finally , I will give you some advice about what you should do for about three hours .
Firstly , we have a nice and interesting museum . It is located near the hotel .
Furthermore , there is a zoo with a lot of different animals , located to walk within five minutes .
For further information please call me ^_^ . I hope you will have an interesting conference here .
In my early childhood , my mother said to me that when she was was a little girl there had ^_^ only one telephone in the house where she ^_^ lived .
It had been in her parents ' apartment .
The neighbours had come in to make their calls and to get their calls .
Today , nobody could imagine such a situation .
In every household there is a telephone at least .
There are a lot of advantages to it .
Firstly , people are able to talk to person at every time . Be it ^_^ just for fun or also to discuss some important and relevant things .
Moreover , we can always ^_^ call for help ^_^ the police , to the hospital or to a doctor .
An other advantage is that all offices , firms and industries could not further exist without it .
It is not an easy decision how to react now .
Another point of disadvantage is that the mobile phones are ringing ^_^ everywhere and at every time .
Thank you for your letter , which arrived yesterday .
I hope to give you ^_^ all the information you need and please , if you want more information or something is not clear , please do n't hesitate to contact me again .
The hotel is near the station and is called " Grand Placad " .
When you arrive you take the train for Guildford and after that you have just cross the road , in front of the station .
It 's a very comfortable hotel where you can find everything you need .
From there to the conference , you have to take the bus number 50 , which stops near the hotel and arrives in the town center .
The conference is organised in the civic hall , so it is very simple to find it .
At the end of the conference , there is a party , a perfect opportunity for your students to meet new friends from all parts of the world and they can speak about their experiences .
I suggest for that conference to wear something very comfortable but elegant . The organisation wants ^_^ all boys to wear a jacket , The tie is not necessary .
I do n't know ^_^ what you can see . Three hours I think is not enough , but near the station there is a beautiful garden popular for its variety of flowers .
If I find something special to visit in three hours , I will call you .
Your sincerely
Dear Ser or Madam
In that area , there are a lot of things you can see and some interesting buildings to visit .
It is the most important church in that area for its architecture .
It is something very special , its paviment made from many small pieces of wood , its windows with many colours . It is fantastic .
It was built on the top of the hill and around there is only a huge field .
You can get here to work because the bus stop is just at the bottom of the hill .
But really you must see it . The position of the cathedral gives you ^_^ something special ^_^ great tranquility .
I look forward to hearing from you .
best regardes
I hope that all the information you need will be answered satisfactorialy .
Secondly , the best way to go from the hotel to the conference center is to use one of the shutel buses we provide at this destination .
It is going to take place in the same hotel , the palace hotel . We suggest casual dressing for this special event .
Finally , concerning your free afternoon , there are plenty of activities , but I suggest you ^_^ to visit the Caldea center which is a very special bath center .
If you need further information , do not hesitate to contact us .
Your sincerely
In your previous letter you asked for information about interesting buildings to visit in my country .
There are plenty of churchs , cathedrals , and old cotages .
The churchs and the cathedral are very interesting because of their different romanics styles .
If you are interested in more modern buildings , I can suggest you ^_^ visit " Caldea " , which is a very modern bath centre with ^_^ beautiful architecture .
Finally , if none of my suggestions fit with your expectations , let me know more about what kind of buildings you are interested in and I 'll do all my best to find something more suitable .
In reply to your letter , I will try to give you some advice .
The conference will take place not far from the hotel , so you will see indications to follow .
For the conference , I suggest you ^_^ wear a beautiful dress , because there will be important people from other colleges .
At the end of the conference , all students and leaders will have a drink .
To finish , if you have spare time , you could walk in the center of Poitiers , which is very beautiful .
I hope I have given you enough details .
I look forward to meeting you at the conference .
What is impressive about this building is the number of tubes that you can see outside and inside the building .
In the Pompidou 's center , there are different expositions on different themes .
These expositions are often very attractive and they change every year .
Another good point , if you go there you will have an extraordinary view of the city .
So if you visit Paris , the Pompidou 's center is a very interesting building to visit , even if in Paris there are many other buildings .
I am writing in response to your letter in order to give you some further information about the international student conference at our college .
It is situated in the center of our town and it takes five minutes to get to the college , where the conference is going to be held .
I think that the best choice for you is to take the 234 bus .
It is an evening dress for women and black trousers , a white shirt and a black bow tie for men .
Lastly , I would like to give you some suggestions about ways in which you can spend your free time in our town .
Also , there is a very good shopping center next to the museum .
I look forward to seeing you at the conference and hope that you will have a good time in our town .
As it is widely known , lots of different and important things were invented during the 20th century , but I believe that the most important one is the computer .
It is a fact ^_^ that ^_^ modern society has created the demand for the ability to cope with the vast amounts of information .
Taking it into consideration , I would like to say that the computer is the priceless invention for ^_^ accountants , designers , engineers and so on and on .
Another point in favour is the possibility to connect to the Internet .
It allows you to have all the necessary information " at your fingertips " .
For instance , a lot of children nowadays replace their real life with the virtual world ^_^ which computers create .
Another drawback is that in industry , computers replace people 's labour , which leads to the increase in unemployment .
To conclude , I would like to say that the governments of all developed countries would n't have been so concerned about the so - called " problem 2000 " if the computer had not been so important for ^_^ modern society .
I thank you for your recent letter .
First , I would like to congratulate you on your new responsibility , because of Mr Brown 's illness .
Your group is staying at the Palace Hotel , which is located directly in front of the bus station .
You have to take ^_^ bus number 1 and get off at " Black House " , which is the third stop .
During it , everybody will have the opportunity to meet and talk to the speakers of the conference .
After the cocktail , the band " Zero one " ^_^ playing their famous songs .
Before your departure , you will have time to visit the Olympic Museum or to take a sightseeing tour of our city .
I hope you will enjoy your journey in our city and look forward to meeting you at this conference .
Yours faithfully ,
There , I saw the exhibition and admired the building itself .
The museum is located in Ouchy , in front of the " Delamuraz Hotel " .
It is close to the main road , and within 300 meters of the station .
Before going inside , you have to pas through the huge garden .
They were all painted during the war by nurses .
If you go down a few steps , you will discover the ceilar .
Everything in this room is about wine .
